    <h4>IN PROSE</h4>
    <h4>A Ghost Story of Christmas</h4>

    <h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>

    <p>I HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,<br>
    to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my<br>
    readers out of humour with themselves, with each other,<br>
    with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses<br>
    pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.</p>

    <h2 id="stave1">STAVE I:  MARLEY&rsquo;S GHOST</h2>

    <p>MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt<br>
    whatever about that. The register of his burial was<br>
    signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,<br>
    and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s name was good upon &rsquo;Change, for anything he<br>
    chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a<br>
    door-nail.</p>

    <p>Mind! I don&rsquo;t mean to say that I know, of my<br>
    own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about<br>
    a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to<br>
    regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery<br>
    in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors<br>
    is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands<br>
    shall not disturb it, or the Country&rsquo;s done for. You<br>
    will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that<br>
    Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</p>

    <p>Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.<br>
    How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were<br>
    partners for I don&rsquo;t know how many years. Scrooge<br>
    was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole<br>
    assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and<br>
    sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully<br>
    cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent<br>
    man of business on the very day of the funeral,<br>
    and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.</p>

    <p>The mention of Marley&rsquo;s funeral brings me back to<br>
    the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley<br>
    was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or<br>
    nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going<br>
    to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that<br>
    Hamlet&rsquo;s Father died before the play began, there<br>
    would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a<br>
    stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,<br>
    than there would be in any other middle-aged<br>
    gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy<br>
    spot&mdash;say Saint Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard for instance&mdash;<br>
    literally to astonish his son&rsquo;s weak mind.</p>

    <p>Scrooge never painted out Old Marley&rsquo;s name.<br>
    There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse<br>
    door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as<br>
    Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the<br>
    business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,<br>
    but he answered to both names. It was all the<br>
    same to him.</p>

    <p>Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,<br>
    Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,<br>
    clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,<br>
    from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;<br>
    secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The<br>
    cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed<br>
    nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his<br>
    eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his<br>
    grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his<br>
    eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low<br>
    temperature always about with him; he iced his office in<br>
    the dog-days; and didn&rsquo;t thaw it one degree at Christmas.</p>

    <p>External heat and cold had little influence on<br>
    Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather<br>
    chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,<br>
    no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no<br>
    pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn&rsquo;t<br>
    know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and<br>
    snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage<br>
    over him in only one respect. They often &ldquo;came down&rdquo;<br>
    handsomely, and Scrooge never did.</p>

    <p>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with<br>
    gladsome looks, &ldquo;My dear Scrooge, how are you?<br>
    When will you come to see me?&rdquo; No beggars implored<br>
    him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him<br>
    what it was o&rsquo;clock, no man or woman ever once in all<br>
    his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of<br>
    Scrooge. Even the blind men&rsquo;s dogs appeared to<br>
    know him; and when they saw him coming on, would<br>
    tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and<br>
    then would wag their tails as though they said, &ldquo;No<br>
    eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing<br>
    he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths<br>
    of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,<br>
    was what the knowing ones call &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; to Scrooge.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time&mdash;of all the good days in the year,<br>
    on Christmas Eve&mdash;old Scrooge sat busy in his<br>
    counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy<br>
    withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,<br>
    go wheezing up and down, beating their hands<br>
    upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the<br>
    pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had<br>
    only just gone three, but it was quite dark already&mdash;<br>
    it had not been light all day&mdash;and candles were flaring<br>
    in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like<br>
    ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog<br>
    came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was<br>
    so dense without, that although the court was of the<br>
    narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.<br>
    To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring<br>
    everything, one might have thought that Nature<br>
    lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.</p>

    <p>The door of Scrooge&rsquo;s counting-house was open<br>
    that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a<br>
    dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying<br>
    letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk&rsquo;s<br>
    fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one<br>
    coal. But he couldn&rsquo;t replenish it, for Scrooge kept<br>
    the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the<br>
    clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted<br>
    that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore<br>
    the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to<br>
    warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being<br>
    a man of a strong imagination, he failed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!&rdquo; cried<br>
    a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge&rsquo;s<br>
    nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was<br>
    the first intimation he had of his approach.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the<br>
    fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge&rsquo;s, that he was<br>
    all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his<br>
    eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Christmas a humbug, uncle!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s<br>
    nephew. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, I am sure?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Merry Christmas! What<br>
    right have you to be merry? What reason have you<br>
    to be merry? You&rsquo;re poor enough.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; returned the nephew gaily. &ldquo;What<br>
    right have you to be dismal? What reason have you<br>
    to be morose? You&rsquo;re rich enough.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur<br>
    of the moment, said, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; again; and followed it up<br>
    with &ldquo;Humbug.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, uncle!&rdquo; said the nephew.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What else can I be,&rdquo; returned the uncle, &ldquo;when I<br>
    live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!<br>
    Out upon merry Christmas! What&rsquo;s Christmas<br>
    time to you but a time for paying bills without<br>
    money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but<br>
    not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books<br>
    and having every item in &lsquo;em through a round dozen<br>
    of months presented dead against you? If I could<br>
    work my will,&rdquo; said Scrooge indignantly, &ldquo;every idiot<br>
    who goes about with &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; on his lips,<br>
    should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried<br>
    with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; pleaded the nephew.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; returned the uncle sternly, &ldquo;keep Christmas<br>
    in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Keep it!&rdquo; repeated Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;But you<br>
    don&rsquo;t keep it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me leave it alone, then,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Much<br>
    good may it do you! Much good it has ever done<br>
    you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There are many things from which I might have<br>
    derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare<br>
    say,&rdquo; returned the nephew. &ldquo;Christmas among the<br>
    rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas<br>
    time, when it has come round&mdash;apart from the<br>
    veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything<br>
    belonging to it can be apart from that&mdash;as a<br>
    good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant<br>
    time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar<br>
    of the year, when men and women seem by one consent<br>
    to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think<br>
    of people below them as if they really were<br>
    fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race<br>
    of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,<br>
    uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or<br>
    silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me<br>
    good, and <i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God bless it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.<br>
    Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,<br>
    he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark<br>
    for ever.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll keep your Christmas by losing<br>
    your situation! You&rsquo;re quite a powerful speaker,<br>
    sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to his nephew. &ldquo;I wonder you<br>
    don&rsquo;t go into Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge said that he would see him&mdash;yes, indeed he<br>
    did. He went the whole length of the expression,<br>
    and said that he would see him in that extremity first.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; cried Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why did you get married?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because I fell in love.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because you fell in love!&rdquo; growled Scrooge, as if<br>
    that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous<br>
    than a merry Christmas. &ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before<br>
    that happened. Why give it as a reason for not<br>
    coming now?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;<br>
    why cannot we be friends?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so<br>
    resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I<br>
    have been a party. But I have made the trial in<br>
    homage to Christmas, and I&rsquo;ll keep my Christmas<br>
    humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And A Happy New Year!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>His nephew left the room without an angry word,<br>
    notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to<br>
    bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,<br>
    cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned<br>
    them cordially.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another fellow,&rdquo; muttered Scrooge; who<br>
    overheard him: &ldquo;my clerk, with fifteen shillings a<br>
    week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry<br>
    Christmas. I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This lunatic, in letting Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew out, had<br>
    let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,<br>
    pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,<br>
    in Scrooge&rsquo;s office. They had books and papers in<br>
    their hands, and bowed to him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Scrooge and Marley&rsquo;s, I believe,&rdquo; said one of the<br>
    gentlemen, referring to his list. &ldquo;Have I the pleasure<br>
    of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,&rdquo;<br>
    Scrooge replied. &ldquo;He died seven years ago, this very<br>
    night.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We have no doubt his liberality is well represented<br>
    by his surviving partner,&rdquo; said the gentleman, presenting<br>
    his credentials.</p>

    <p>It certainly was; for they had been two kindred<br>
    spirits. At the ominous word &ldquo;liberality,&rdquo; Scrooge<br>
    frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials<br>
    back.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&rdquo;<br>
    said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &ldquo;it is more than<br>
    usually desirable that we should make some slight<br>
    provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer<br>
    greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in<br>
    want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands<br>
    are in want of common comforts, sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are there no prisons?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Plenty of prisons,&rdquo; said the gentleman, laying down<br>
    the pen again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And the Union workhouses?&rdquo; demanded Scrooge.<br>
    "Are they still in operation?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They are. Still,&rdquo; returned the gentleman, &ldquo;I wish<br>
    I could say they were not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,<br>
    then?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Both very busy, sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,<br>
    that something had occurred to stop them in their<br>
    useful course,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to<br>
    hear it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Under the impression that they scarcely furnish<br>
    Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,&rdquo;<br>
    returned the gentleman, &ldquo;a few of us are endeavouring<br>
    to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,<br>
    and means of warmth. We choose this time, because<br>
    it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,<br>
    and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down<br>
    for?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Scrooge replied.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You wish to be anonymous?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish to be left alone,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Since you<br>
    ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.<br>
    I don&rsquo;t make merry myself at Christmas and I can&rsquo;t<br>
    afford to make idle people merry. I help to support<br>
    the establishments I have mentioned&mdash;they cost<br>
    enough; and those who are badly off must go there.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Many can&rsquo;t go there; and many would rather die.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If they would rather die,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;they had<br>
    better do it, and decrease the surplus population.<br>
    Besides&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But you might know it,&rdquo; observed the gentleman.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my business,&rdquo; Scrooge returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s<br>
    enough for a man to understand his own business, and<br>
    not to interfere with other people&rsquo;s. Mine occupies<br>
    me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue<br>
    their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed<br>
    his labours with an improved opinion of himself,<br>
    and in a more facetious temper than was usual<br>
    with him.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that<br>
    people ran about with flaring links, proffering their<br>
    services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct<br>
    them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,<br>
    whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down<br>
    at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became<br>
    invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the<br>
    clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if<br>
    its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.<br>
    The cold became intense. In the main street, at the<br>
    corner of the court, some labourers were repairing<br>
    the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,<br>
    round which a party of ragged men and boys were<br>
    gathered: warming their hands and winking their<br>
    eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug<br>
    being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,<br>
    and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness<br>
    of the shops where holly sprigs and berries<br>
    crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale<br>
    faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers&rsquo; and grocers&rsquo;<br>
    trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,<br>
    with which it was next to impossible to believe that<br>
    such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything<br>
    to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the<br>
    mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks<br>
    and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s<br>
    household should; and even the little tailor, whom he<br>
    had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for<br>
    being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up<br>
    to-morrow&rsquo;s pudding in his garret, while his lean<br>
    wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.</p>

    <p>Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting<br>
    cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped<br>
    the Evil Spirit&rsquo;s nose with a touch of such weather<br>
    as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then<br>
    indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The<br>
    owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled<br>
    by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,<br>
    stooped down at Scrooge&rsquo;s keyhole to regale him with<br>
    a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of</p>

    <blockquote>        &ldquo;God bless you, merry gentleman!<br>
             May nothing you dismay!&rdquo;</blockquote>

    <p>Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,<br>
    that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to<br>
    the fog and even more congenial frost.</p>

    <p>At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house<br>
    arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his<br>
    stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant<br>
    clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,<br>
    and put on his hat.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If quite convenient, sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not convenient,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not<br>
    fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you&rsquo;d<br>
    think yourself ill-used, I&rsquo;ll be bound?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The clerk smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think <i>me</i> ill-used,<br>
    when I pay a day&rsquo;s wages for no work.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The clerk observed that it was only once a year.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A poor excuse for picking a man&rsquo;s pocket every<br>
    twenty-fifth of December!&rdquo; said Scrooge, buttoning<br>
    his great-coat to the chin. &ldquo;But I suppose you must<br>
    have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next<br>
    morning.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge<br>
    walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a<br>
    twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his<br>
    white comforter dangling below his waist (for he<br>
    boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,<br>
    at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in<br>
    honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home<br>
    to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play<br>
    at blindman&rsquo;s-buff.</p>

    <p>Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual<br>
    melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and<br>
    beguiled the rest of the evening with his<br>
    banker&rsquo;s-book, went home to bed. He lived in<br>
    chambers which had once belonged to his deceased<br>
    partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a<br>
    lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so<br>
    little business to be, that one could scarcely help<br>
    fancying it must have run there when it was a young<br>
    house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,<br>
    and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough<br>
    now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but<br>
    Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.<br>
    The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew<br>
    its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.<br>
    The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway<br>
    of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of<br>
    the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the<br>
    threshold.</p>

    <p>Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all<br>
    particular about the knocker on the door, except that it<br>
    was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had<br>
    seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence<br>
    in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what<br>
    is called fancy about him as any man in the city of<br>
    London, even including&mdash;which is a bold word&mdash;the<br>
    corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be<br>
    borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one<br>
    thought on Marley, since his last mention of his<br>
    seven years&rsquo; dead partner that afternoon. And then<br>
    let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened<br>
    that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,<br>
    saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate<br>
    process of change&mdash;not a knocker, but Marley&rsquo;s face.</p>

    <p>Marley&rsquo;s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow<br>
    as the other objects in the yard were, but had a<br>
    dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark<br>
    cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked<br>
    at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly<br>
    spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The<br>
    hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;<br>
    and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly<br>
    motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it<br>
    horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the<br>
    face and beyond its control, rather than a part of<br>
    its own expression.</p>

    <p>As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it<br>
    was a knocker again.</p>

    <p>To say that he was not startled, or that his blood<br>
    was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it<br>
    had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.<br>
    But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,<br>
    turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.</p>

    <p>He <i>did</i> pause, with a moment&rsquo;s irresolution, before<br>
    he shut the door; and he <i>did</i> look cautiously behind<br>
    it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the<br>
    sight of Marley&rsquo;s pigtail sticking out into the hall.<br>
    But there was nothing on the back of the door, except<br>
    the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he<br>
    said &ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; and closed it with a bang.</p>

    <p>The sound resounded through the house like thunder.<br>
    Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant&rsquo;s<br>
    cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal<br>
    of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to<br>
    be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and<br>
    walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:<br>
    trimming his candle as he went.</p>

    <p>You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six<br>
    up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad<br>
    young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you<br>
    might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken<br>
    it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall<br>
    and the door towards the balustrades: and done it<br>
    easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room<br>
    to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge<br>
    thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before<br>
    him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of<br>
    the street wouldn&rsquo;t have lighted the entry too well,<br>
    so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s dip.</p>

    <p>Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.<br>
    Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before<br>
    he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms<br>
    to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection<br>
    of the face to desire to do that.</p>

    <p>Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they<br>
    should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under<br>
    the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin<br>
    ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had<br>
    a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the<br>
    bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,<br>
    which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude<br>
    against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,<br>
    old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three<br>
    legs, and a poker.</p>

    <p>Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked<br>
    himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his<br>
    custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off<br>
    his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and<br>
    his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take<br>
    his gruel.</p>

    <p>It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a<br>
    bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and<br>
    brood over it, before he could extract the least<br>
    sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.<br>
    The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch<br>
    merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint<br>
    Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.<br>
    There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughters;<br>
    Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending<br>
    through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,<br>
    Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,<br>
    hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;<br>
    and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came<br>
    like the ancient Prophet&rsquo;s rod, and swallowed up the<br>
    whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,<br>
    with power to shape some picture on its surface from<br>
    the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would<br>
    have been a copy of old Marley&rsquo;s head on every one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; said Scrooge; and walked across the<br>
    room.</p>

    <p>After several turns, he sat down again. As he<br>
    threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened<br>
    to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the<br>
    room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten<br>
    with a chamber in the highest story of the<br>
    building. It was with great astonishment, and with<br>
    a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he<br>
    saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in<br>
    the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it<br>
    rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.</p>

    <p>This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,<br>
    but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had<br>
    begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking<br>
    noise, deep down below; as if some person were<br>
    dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the<br>
    wine-merchant&rsquo;s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have<br>
    heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as<br>
    dragging chains.</p>

    <p>The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,<br>
    and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors<br>
    below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight<br>
    towards his door.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s humbug still!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His colour changed though, when, without a pause,<br>
    it came on through the heavy door, and passed into<br>
    the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the<br>
    dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, &ldquo;I know<br>
    him; Marley&rsquo;s Ghost!&rdquo; and fell again.</p>

    <p>The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,<br>
    usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on<br>
    the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,<br>
    and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was<br>
    clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound<br>
    about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge<br>
    observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,<br>
    ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.<br>
    His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,<br>
    and looking through his waistcoat, could see<br>
    the two buttons on his coat behind.</p>

    <p>Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no<br>
    bowels, but he had never believed it until now.</p>

    <p>No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he<br>
    looked the phantom through and through, and saw<br>
    it standing before him; though he felt the chilling<br>
    influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very<br>
    texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head<br>
    and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;<br>
    he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How now!&rdquo; said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.<br>
    "What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Much!"&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s voice, no doubt about it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ask me who I <i>was</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who <i>were</i> you then?&rdquo; said Scrooge, raising his<br>
    voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re particular, for a shade.&rdquo; He was going<br>
    to say &ldquo;<i>to</i> a shade,&rdquo; but substituted this, as more<br>
    appropriate.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Can you&mdash;can you sit down?&rdquo; asked Scrooge, looking<br>
    doubtfully at him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do it, then.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge asked the question, because he didn&rsquo;t know<br>
    whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in<br>
    a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event<br>
    of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity<br>
    of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat<br>
    down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he<br>
    were quite used to it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in me,&rdquo; observed the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of<br>
    your senses?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why do you doubt your senses?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;a little thing affects them.<br>
    A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may<br>
    be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of<br>
    cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There&rsquo;s more of<br>
    gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking<br>
    jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means<br>
    waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be<br>
    smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,<br>
    and keeping down his terror; for the spectre&rsquo;s voice<br>
    disturbed the very marrow in his bones.</p>

    <p>To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence<br>
    for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very<br>
    deuce with him. There was something very awful,<br>
    too, in the spectre&rsquo;s being provided with an infernal<br>
    atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it<br>
    himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the<br>
    Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,<br>
    and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour<br>
    from an oven.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You see this toothpick?&rdquo; said Scrooge, returning<br>
    quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;<br>
    and wishing, though it were only for a second, to<br>
    divert the vision&rsquo;s stony gaze from himself.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are not looking at it,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But I see it,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; returned Scrooge, &ldquo;I have but to swallow<br>
    this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a<br>
    legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,<br>
    I tell you! humbug!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook<br>
    its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that<br>
    Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself<br>
    from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was<br>
    his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage<br>
    round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,<br>
    its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!</p>

    <p>Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands<br>
    before his face.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dreadful apparition, why do<br>
    you trouble me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Man of the worldly mind!&rdquo; replied the Ghost, &ldquo;do<br>
    you believe in me or not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I must. But why do spirits<br>
    walk the earth, and why do they come to me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is required of every man,&rdquo; the Ghost returned,<br>
    "that the spirit within him should walk abroad among<br>
    his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that<br>
    spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so<br>
    after death. It is doomed to wander through the<br>
    world&mdash;oh, woe is me!&mdash;and witness what it cannot<br>
    share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to<br>
    happiness!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain<br>
    and wrung its shadowy hands.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are fettered,&rdquo; said Scrooge, trembling. &ldquo;Tell<br>
    me why?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wear the chain I forged in life,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.<br>
    "I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded<br>
    it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I<br>
    wore it. Is its pattern strange to <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge trembled more and more.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Or would you know,&rdquo; pursued the Ghost, &ldquo;the<br>
    weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?<br>
    It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven<br>
    Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.<br>
    It is a ponderous chain!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the<br>
    expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty<br>
    or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see<br>
    nothing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; he said, imploringly. &ldquo;Old Jacob Marley,<br>
    tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have none to give,&rdquo; the Ghost replied. &ldquo;It comes<br>
    from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed<br>
    by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor<br>
    can I tell you what I would. A very little more is<br>
    all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I<br>
    cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked<br>
    beyond our counting-house&mdash;mark me!&mdash;in life my<br>
    spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our<br>
    money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before<br>
    me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became<br>
    thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.<br>
    Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,<br>
    but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his<br>
    knees.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,&rdquo;<br>
    Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though<br>
    with humility and deference.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Slow!&rdquo; the Ghost repeated.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Seven years dead,&rdquo; mused Scrooge. &ldquo;And travelling<br>
    all the time!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The whole time,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;No rest, no<br>
    peace. Incessant torture of remorse.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You travel fast?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On the wings of the wind,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You might have got over a great quantity of<br>
    ground in seven years,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and<br>
    clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of<br>
    the night, that the Ward would have been justified in<br>
    indicting it for a nuisance.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,&rdquo; cried the<br>
    phantom, &ldquo;not to know, that ages of incessant labour<br>
    by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into<br>
    eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is<br>
    all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit<br>
    working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may<br>
    be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast<br>
    means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of<br>
    regret can make amends for one life&rsquo;s opportunity<br>
    misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But you were always a good man of business,<br>
    Jacob,&rdquo; faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this<br>
    to himself.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Business!&rdquo; cried the Ghost, wringing its hands<br>
    again. &ldquo;Mankind was my business. The common<br>
    welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,<br>
    and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings<br>
    of my trade were but a drop of water in the<br>
    comprehensive ocean of my business!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It held up its chain at arm&rsquo;s length, as if that were<br>
    the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it<br>
    heavily upon the ground again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At this time of the rolling year,&rdquo; the spectre said,<br>
    "I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of<br>
    fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never<br>
    raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise<br>
    Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to<br>
    which its light would have conducted <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the<br>
    spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake<br>
    exceedingly.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; cried the Ghost. &ldquo;My time is nearly<br>
    gone.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be hard upon<br>
    me! Don&rsquo;t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How it is that I appear before you in a shape that<br>
    you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible<br>
    beside you many and many a day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,<br>
    and wiped the perspiration from his brow.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That is no light part of my penance,&rdquo; pursued<br>
    the Ghost. &ldquo;I am here to-night to warn you, that you<br>
    have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A<br>
    chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You were always a good friend to me,&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge. &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You will be haunted,&rdquo; resumed the Ghost, &ldquo;by<br>
    Three Spirits.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s countenance fell almost as low as the<br>
    Ghost&rsquo;s had done.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,<br>
    Jacob?&rdquo; he demanded, in a faltering voice.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Without their visits,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;you cannot<br>
    hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,<br>
    when the bell tolls One.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I take &rsquo;em all at once, and have it over,<br>
    Jacob?&rdquo; hinted Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Expect the second on the next night at the same<br>
    hour. The third upon the next night when the last<br>
    stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see<br>
    me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you<br>
    remember what has passed between us!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When it had said these words, the spectre took its<br>
    wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,<br>
    as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its<br>
    teeth made, when the jaws were brought together<br>
    by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,<br>
    and found his supernatural visitor confronting him<br>
    in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and<br>
    about its arm.</p>

    <p>The apparition walked backward from him; and at<br>
    every step it took, the window raised itself a little,<br>
    so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.</p>

    <p>It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.<br>
    When they were within two paces of each other,<br>
    Marley&rsquo;s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to<br>
    come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.</p>

    <p>Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:<br>
    for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible<br>
    of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of<br>
    lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and<br>
    self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,<br>
    joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the<br>
    bleak, dark night.</p>

    <p>Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his<br>
    curiosity. He looked out.</p>

    <p>The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither<br>
    and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they<br>
    went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley&rsquo;s<br>
    Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)<br>
    were linked together; none were free. Many had<br>
    been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He<br>
    had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white<br>
    waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to<br>
    its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist<br>
    a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,<br>
    upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,<br>
    clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in<br>
    human matters, and had lost the power for ever.</p>

    <p>Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist<br>
    enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and<br>
    their spirit voices faded together; and the night became<br>
    as it had been when he walked home.</p>

    <p>Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door<br>
    by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,<br>
    as he had locked it with his own hands, and<br>
    the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say &ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo;<br>
    but stopped at the first syllable. And being,<br>
    from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues<br>
    of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or<br>
    the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of<br>
    the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to<br>
    bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the<br>
    instant.</p>

    <h2 id="stave2">STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS</h2>

    <p>WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,<br>
    he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from<br>
    the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to<br>
    pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a<br>
    neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened<br>
    for the hour.</p>

    <p>To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from<br>
    six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to<br>
    twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he<br>
    went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have<br>
    got into the works. Twelve!</p>

    <p>He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most<br>
    preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:<br>
    and stopped.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;that I can have<br>
    slept through a whole day and far into another night. It<br>
    isn&rsquo;t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and<br>
    this is twelve at noon!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,<br>
    and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub<br>
    the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he<br>
    could see anything; and could see very little then. All he<br>
    could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely<br>
    cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,<br>
    and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been<br>
    if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the<br>
    world.  This was a great relief, because &ldquo;three days after sight<br>
    of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his<br>
    order,&rdquo; and so forth, would have become a mere United States&rsquo;<br>
    security if there were no days to count by.</p>

    <p>Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought<br>
    it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he<br>
    thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured<br>
    not to think, the more he thought.</p>

    <p>Marley&rsquo;s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved<br>
    within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his<br>
    mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first<br>
    position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,<br>
    "Was it a dream or not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters<br>
    more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned<br>
    him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie<br>
    awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could<br>
    no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the<br>
    wisest resolution in his power.</p>

    <p>The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he<br>
    must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.<br>
    At length it broke upon his listening ear.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A quarter past,&rdquo; said Scrooge, counting.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Half-past!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A quarter to it,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The hour itself,&rdquo; said Scrooge, triumphantly, &ldquo;and nothing else!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a<br>
    deep, dull, hollow, melancholy <font style="font-variant: small-caps">One</font>.  Light flashed up in the room<br>
    upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.</p>

    <p>The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a<br>
    hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his<br>
    back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains<br>
    of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a<br>
    half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the<br>
    unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now<br>
    to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.</p>

    <p>It was a strange figure&mdash;like a child: yet not so like a<br>
    child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural<br>
    medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded<br>
    from the view, and being diminished to a child&rsquo;s proportions.<br>
    Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was<br>
    white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in<br>
    it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were<br>
    very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold<br>
    were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately<br>
    formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic<br>
    of the purest white; and round its waist was bound<br>
    a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held<br>
    a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular<br>
    contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed<br>
    with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,<br>
    that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear<br>
    jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was<br>
    doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a<br>
    great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.</p>

    <p>Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing<br>
    steadiness, was <i>not</i> its strangest quality. For as its belt<br>
    sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,<br>
    and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so<br>
    the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a<br>
    thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,<br>
    now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a<br>
    body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible<br>
    in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the<br>
    very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and<br>
    clear as ever.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to<br>
    me?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if<br>
    instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who, and what are you?&rdquo; Scrooge demanded.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Long past?&rdquo; inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish<br>
    stature.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. Your past.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if<br>
    anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire<br>
    to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Ghost, &ldquo;would you so soon put out,<br>
    with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough<br>
    that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and<br>
    force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon<br>
    my brow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend<br>
    or any knowledge of having wilfully &ldquo;bonneted&rdquo; the Spirit at<br>
    any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what<br>
    business brought him there.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your welfare!&rdquo; said the Ghost.</p>

    <p>Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not<br>
    help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been<br>
    more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard<br>
    him thinking, for it said immediately:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your reclamation, then. Take heed!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him<br>
    gently by the arm.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Rise! and walk with me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the<br>
    weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;<br>
    that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below<br>
    freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,<br>
    dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at<br>
    that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman&rsquo;s hand,<br>
    was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit<br>
    made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am a mortal,&rdquo; Scrooge remonstrated, &ldquo;and liable to fall.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bear but a touch of my hand <i>there</i>,&rdquo; said the Spirit,<br>
    laying it upon his heart, &ldquo;and you shall be upheld in more<br>
    than this!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,<br>
    and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either<br>
    hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it<br>
    was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished<br>
    with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon<br>
    the ground.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,<br>
    as he looked about him. &ldquo;I was bred in this place. I was<br>
    a boy here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,<br>
    though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still<br>
    present to the old man&rsquo;s sense of feeling. He was conscious<br>
    of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected<br>
    with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares<br>
    long, long, forgotten!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your lip is trembling,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;And what is<br>
    that upon your cheek?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,<br>
    that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him<br>
    where he would.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You recollect the way?&rdquo; inquired the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Remember it!&rdquo; cried Scrooge with fervour; &ldquo;I could<br>
    walk it blindfold.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!&rdquo; observed<br>
    the Ghost. &ldquo;Let us go on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every<br>
    gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared<br>
    in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.<br>
    Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them<br>
    with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in<br>
    country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys<br>
    were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the<br>
    broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air<br>
    laughed to hear it!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;These are but shadows of the things that have been,&rdquo; said<br>
    the Ghost. &ldquo;They have no consciousness of us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge<br>
    knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond<br>
    all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and<br>
    his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled<br>
    with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry<br>
    Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for<br>
    their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?<br>
    Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done<br>
    to him?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The school is not quite deserted,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;A<br>
    solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.</p>

    <p>They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and<br>
    soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little<br>
    weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell<br>
    hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken<br>
    fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls<br>
    were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their<br>
    gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;<br>
    and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.<br>
    Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for<br>
    entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open<br>
    doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,<br>
    cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a<br>
    chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow<br>
    with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too<br>
    much to eat.</p>

    <p>They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a<br>
    door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and<br>
    disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by<br>
    lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely<br>
    boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down<br>
    upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he<br>
    used to be.</p>

    <p>Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle<br>
    from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the<br>
    half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among<br>
    the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle<br>
    swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in<br>
    the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening<br>
    influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.</p>

    <p>The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his<br>
    younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in<br>
    foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:<br>
    stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and<br>
    leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Ali Baba!&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s<br>
    dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas<br>
    time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,<br>
    he <i>did</i> come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And<br>
    Valentine,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;and his wild brother, Orson; there<br>
    they go! And what&rsquo;s his name, who was put down in his<br>
    drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don&rsquo;t you see him!<br>
    And the Sultan&rsquo;s Groom turned upside down by the Genii;<br>
    there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I&rsquo;m glad of it.<br>
    What business had <i>he</i> to be married to the Princess!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature<br>
    on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between<br>
    laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited<br>
    face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in<br>
    the city, indeed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Parrot!&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;Green body and<br>
    yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the<br>
    top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called<br>
    him, when he came home again after sailing round the<br>
    island. &lsquo;Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin<br>
    Crusoe?&rsquo;  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn&rsquo;t.<br>
    It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running<br>
    for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his<br>
    usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, &ldquo;Poor<br>
    boy!&rdquo; and cried again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his<br>
    pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his<br>
    cuff: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Nothing. There was a boy<br>
    singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should<br>
    like to have given him something: that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:<br>
    saying as it did so, &ldquo;Let us see another Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s former self grew larger at the words, and the<br>
    room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,<br>
    the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the<br>
    ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how<br>
    all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you<br>
    do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything<br>
    had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all<br>
    the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.</p>

    <p>He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.<br>
    Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of<br>
    his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.</p>

    <p>It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,<br>
    came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and<br>
    often kissing him, addressed him as her &ldquo;Dear, dear<br>
    brother.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have come to bring you home, dear brother!&rdquo; said the<br>
    child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.<br>
    "To bring you home, home, home!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Home, little Fan?&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the child, brimful of glee. &ldquo;Home, for good<br>
    and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder<br>
    than he used to be, that home&rsquo;s like Heaven! He spoke so<br>
    gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that<br>
    I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come<br>
    home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach<br>
    to bring you. And you&rsquo;re to be a man!&rdquo; said the child,<br>
    opening her eyes, &ldquo;and are never to come back here; but<br>
    first, we&rsquo;re to be together all the Christmas long, and have<br>
    the merriest time in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are quite a woman, little Fan!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.</p>

    <p>She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his<br>
    head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on<br>
    tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her<br>
    childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to<br>
    go, accompanied her.</p>

    <p>A terrible voice in the hall cried, &ldquo;Bring down Master<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s box, there!&rdquo; and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster<br>
    himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious<br>
    condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind<br>
    by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his<br>
    sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that<br>
    ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial<br>
    and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.<br>
    Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a<br>
    block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments<br>
    of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,<br>
    sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of &ldquo;something&rdquo;<br>
    to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,<br>
    but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had<br>
    rather not. Master Scrooge&rsquo;s trunk being by this time tied<br>
    on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster<br>
    good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove<br>
    gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the<br>
    hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens<br>
    like spray.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have<br>
    withered,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;But she had a large heart!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So she had,&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I will not<br>
    gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She died a woman,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;and had, as I think,<br>
    children.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One child,&rdquo; Scrooge returned.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;Your nephew!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,<br>
    "Yes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Although they had but that moment left the school behind<br>
    them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,<br>
    where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy<br>
    carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and<br>
    tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by<br>
    the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas<br>
    time again; but it was evening, and the streets were<br>
    lighted up.</p>

    <p>The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked<br>
    Scrooge if he knew it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Know it!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Was I apprenticed here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh<br>
    wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two<br>
    inches taller he must have knocked his head against the<br>
    ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it&rsquo;s Fezziwig<br>
    alive again!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the<br>
    clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his<br>
    hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over<br>
    himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and<br>
    called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly<br>
    in, accompanied by his fellow-&rsquo;prentice.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dick Wilkins, to be sure!&rdquo; said Scrooge to the Ghost.<br>
    "Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached<br>
    to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yo ho, my boys!&rdquo; said Fezziwig. &ldquo;No more work to-night.<br>
    Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let&rsquo;s<br>
    have the shutters up,&rdquo; cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap<br>
    of his hands, &ldquo;before a man can say Jack Robinson!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how those two fellows went at it!<br>
    They charged into the street with the shutters&mdash;one, two,<br>
    three&mdash;had &rsquo;em up in their places&mdash;four, five, six&mdash;barred<br>
    &rsquo;em and pinned &rsquo;em&mdash;seven, eight, nine&mdash;and came back<br>
    before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hilli-ho!&rdquo; cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the<br>
    high desk, with wonderful agility. &ldquo;Clear away, my lads,<br>
    and let&rsquo;s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,<br>
    Ebenezer!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn&rsquo;t have cleared<br>
    away, or couldn&rsquo;t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking<br>
    on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if<br>
    it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was<br>
    swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon<br>
    the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and<br>
    bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter&rsquo;s<br>
    night.</p>

    <p>In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the<br>
    lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty<br>
    stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial<br>
    smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and<br>
    lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they<br>
    broke. In came all the young men and women employed in<br>
    the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the<br>
    baker. In came the cook, with her brother&rsquo;s particular friend,<br>
    the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was<br>
    suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying<br>
    to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who<br>
    was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.<br>
    In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,<br>
    some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;<br>
    in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,<br>
    twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again<br>
    the other way; down the middle and up again; round<br>
    and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old<br>
    top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top<br>
    couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top<br>
    couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When<br>
    this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his<br>
    hands to stop the dance, cried out, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; and the<br>
    fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially<br>
    provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his<br>
    reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no<br>
    dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,<br>
    exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man<br>
    resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.</p>

    <p>There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more<br>
    dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there<br>
    was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece<br>
    of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.<br>
    But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast<br>
    and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort<br>
    of man who knew his business better than you or I could<br>
    have told it him!) struck up &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverley.&rdquo;  Then<br>
    old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top<br>
    couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;<br>
    three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were<br>
    not to be trifled with; people who <i>would</i> dance, and had no<br>
    notion of walking.</p>

    <p>But if they had been twice as many&mdash;ah, four times&mdash;old<br>
    Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would<br>
    Mrs. Fezziwig. As to <i>her</i>, she was worthy to be his partner<br>
    in every sense of the term. If that&rsquo;s not high praise, tell me<br>
    higher, and I&rsquo;ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue<br>
    from Fezziwig&rsquo;s calves. They shone in every part of the<br>
    dance like moons. You couldn&rsquo;t have predicted, at any given<br>
    time, what would have become of them next. And when old<br>
    Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;<br>
    advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and<br>
    curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to<br>
    your place; Fezziwig &ldquo;cut"&mdash;cut so deftly, that he appeared<br>
    to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without<br>
    a stagger.</p>

    <p>When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.<br>
    Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side<br>
    of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually<br>
    as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.<br>
    When everybody had retired but the two &rsquo;prentices, they did<br>
    the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,<br>
    and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a<br>
    counter in the back-shop.</p>

    <p>During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a<br>
    man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,<br>
    and with his former self. He corroborated everything,<br>
    remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent<br>
    the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the<br>
    bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from<br>
    them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious<br>
    that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its<br>
    head burnt very clear.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A small matter,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;to make these silly<br>
    folks so full of gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Small!&rdquo; echoed Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,<br>
    who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:<br>
    and when he had done so, said,</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of<br>
    your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so<br>
    much that he deserves this praise?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and<br>
    speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.<br>
    "It isn&rsquo;t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy<br>
    or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a<br>
    pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and<br>
    looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is<br>
    impossible to add and count &rsquo;em up: what then? The happiness<br>
    he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He felt the Spirit&rsquo;s glance, and stopped.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing particular,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Something, I think?&rdquo; the Ghost insisted.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;No. I should like to be able to say<br>
    a word or two to my clerk just now. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance<br>
    to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by<br>
    side in the open air.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My time grows short,&rdquo; observed the Spirit. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he<br>
    could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again<br>
    Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime<br>
    of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later<br>
    years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.<br>
    There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which<br>
    showed the passion that had taken root, and where the<br>
    shadow of the growing tree would fall.</p>

    <p>He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young<br>
    girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,<br>
    which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of<br>
    Christmas Past.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;To you, very little.<br>
    Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort<br>
    you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have<br>
    no just cause to grieve.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What Idol has displaced you?&rdquo; he rejoined.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A golden one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This is the even-handed dealing of the world!&rdquo; he said.<br>
    "There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and<br>
    there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity<br>
    as the pursuit of wealth!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You fear the world too much,&rdquo; she answered, gently.<br>
    "All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being<br>
    beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your<br>
    nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,<br>
    Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Even if I have grown so<br>
    much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She shook her head.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were<br>
    both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could<br>
    improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You<br>
    <i>are</i> changed. When it was made, you were another man.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was a boy,&rdquo; he said impatiently.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you<br>
    are,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I am. That which promised happiness<br>
    when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that<br>
    we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of<br>
    this, I will not say. It is enough that I <i>have</i> thought of it,<br>
    and can release you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have I ever sought release?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In words. No. Never.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In what, then?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another<br>
    atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In<br>
    everything that made my love of any worth or value in your<br>
    sight. If this had never been between us,&rdquo; said the girl,<br>
    looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; &ldquo;tell me,<br>
    would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in<br>
    spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, &ldquo;You think<br>
    not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I would gladly think otherwise if I could,&rdquo; she answered,<br>
    "Heaven knows! When <i>I</i> have learned a Truth like this,<br>
    I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you<br>
    were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe<br>
    that you would choose a dowerless girl&mdash;you who, in your<br>
    very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,<br>
    choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your<br>
    one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your<br>
    repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I<br>
    release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you<br>
    once were.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He was about to speak; but with her head turned from<br>
    him, she resumed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You may&mdash;the memory of what is past half makes me<br>
    hope you will&mdash;have pain in this. A very, very brief time,<br>
    and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an<br>
    unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you<br>
    awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She left him, and they parted.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;show me no more! Conduct<br>
    me home. Why do you delight to torture me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One shadow more!&rdquo; exclaimed the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No more!&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;No more. I don&rsquo;t wish to<br>
    see it. Show me no more!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,<br>
    and forced him to observe what happened next.</p>

    <p>They were in another scene and place; a room, not very<br>
    large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter<br>
    fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge<br>
    believed it was the same, until he saw <i>her</i>, now a comely<br>
    matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this<br>
    room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children<br>
    there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;<br>
    and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not<br>
    forty children conducting themselves like one, but every<br>
    child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences<br>
    were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;<br>
    on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,<br>
    and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to<br>
    mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands<br>
    most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of<br>
    them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I<br>
    wouldn&rsquo;t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that<br>
    braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little<br>
    shoe, I wouldn&rsquo;t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to<br>
    save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they<br>
    did, bold young brood, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it; I should<br>
    have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,<br>
    and never come straight again. And yet I should<br>
    have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have<br>
    questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have<br>
    looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never<br>
    raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of<br>
    which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should<br>
    have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence<br>
    of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its<br>
    value.</p>

    <p>But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a<br>
    rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and<br>
    plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed<br>
    and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who<br>
    came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys<br>
    and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and<br>
    the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!<br>
    The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his<br>
    pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight<br>
    by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,<br>
    and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of<br>
    wonder and delight with which the development of every<br>
    package was received! The terrible announcement that the<br>
    baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll&rsquo;s frying-pan<br>
    into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having<br>
    swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!<br>
    The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,<br>
    and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.<br>
    It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions<br>
    got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the<br>
    top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.</p>

    <p>And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,<br>
    when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning<br>
    fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his<br>
    own fireside; and when he thought that such another<br>
    creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might<br>
    have called him father, and been a spring-time in the<br>
    haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said the husband, turning to his wife with a<br>
    smile, &ldquo;I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How can I? Tut, don&rsquo;t I know?&rdquo; she added in the<br>
    same breath, laughing as he laughed. &ldquo;Mr. Scrooge.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as<br>
    it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could<br>
    scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point<br>
    of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in<br>
    the world, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge in a broken voice, &ldquo;remove me<br>
    from this place.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I told you these were shadows of the things that have<br>
    been,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;That they are what they are, do<br>
    not blame me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Remove me!&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed, &ldquo;I cannot bear it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon<br>
    him with a face, in which in some strange way there were<br>
    fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which<br>
    the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was<br>
    undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed<br>
    that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly<br>
    connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the<br>
    extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down<br>
    upon its head.</p>

    <p>The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher<br>
    covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down<br>
    with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed<br>
    from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.</p>

    <p>He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an<br>
    irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own<br>
    bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand<br>
    relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank<br>
    into a heavy sleep.</p>

    <h2 id="stave3">STAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS</h2>

    <p>AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and<br>
    sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had<br>
    no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the<br>
    stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness<br>
    in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding<br>
    a conference with the second messenger despatched to him<br>
    through Jacob Marley&rsquo;s intervention. But finding that he<br>
    turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which<br>
    of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put<br>
    them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down<br>
    again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For<br>
    he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its<br>
    appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and<br>
    made nervous.</p>

    <p>Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves<br>
    on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually<br>
    equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their<br>
    capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for<br>
    anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which<br>
    opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and<br>
    comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for<br>
    Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don&rsquo;t mind calling on you<br>
    to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of<br>
    strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and<br>
    rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.</p>

    <p>Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by<br>
    any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the<br>
    Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a<br>
    violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter<br>
    of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay<br>
    upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy<br>
    light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the<br>
    hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than<br>
    a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it<br>
    meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive<br>
    that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of<br>
    spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of<br>
    knowing it. At last, however, he began to think&mdash;as you or<br>
    I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not<br>
    in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done<br>
    in it, and would unquestionably have done it too&mdash;at last, I<br>
    say, he began to think that the source and secret of this<br>
    ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,<br>
    on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking<br>
    full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in<br>
    his slippers to the door.</p>

    <p>The moment Scrooge&rsquo;s hand was on the lock, a strange<br>
    voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He<br>
    obeyed.</p>

    <p>It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.<br>
    But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls<br>
    and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a<br>
    perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming<br>
    berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and<br>
    ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had<br>
    been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring<br>
    up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had<br>
    never known in Scrooge&rsquo;s time, or Marley&rsquo;s, or for many and<br>
    many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form<br>
    a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,<br>
    great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,<br>
    mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,<br>
    cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,<br>
    immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that<br>
    made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy<br>
    state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to<br>
    see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty&rsquo;s<br>
    horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,<br>
    as he came peeping round the door.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; exclaimed the Ghost. &ldquo;Come in! and know<br>
    me better, man!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this<br>
    Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and<br>
    though the Spirit&rsquo;s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like<br>
    to meet them.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,&rdquo; said the Spirit.<br>
    "Look upon me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple<br>
    green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment<br>
    hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was<br>
    bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any<br>
    artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the<br>
    garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other<br>
    covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining<br>
    icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its<br>
    genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,<br>
    its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded<br>
    round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword<br>
    was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You have never seen the like of me before!&rdquo; exclaimed<br>
    the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Scrooge made answer to it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have never walked forth with the younger members of<br>
    my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers<br>
    born in these later years?&rdquo; pursued the Phantom.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I am afraid I have<br>
    not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;More than eighteen hundred,&rdquo; said the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A tremendous family to provide for!&rdquo; muttered Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; said Scrooge submissively, &ldquo;conduct me where<br>
    you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt<br>
    a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught<br>
    to teach me, let me profit by it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Touch my robe!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.</p>

    <p>Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,<br>
    poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,<br>
    fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,<br>
    the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood<br>
    in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the<br>
    weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and<br>
    not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the<br>
    pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of<br>
    their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see<br>
    it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting<br>
    into artificial little snow-storms.</p>

    <p>The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows<br>
    blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow<br>
    upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;<br>
    which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by<br>
    the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed<br>
    and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great<br>
    streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace<br>
    in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,<br>
    and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,<br>
    half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended<br>
    in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great<br>
    Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away<br>
    to their dear hearts content. There was nothing very cheerful<br>
    in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of<br>
    cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest<br>
    summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.</p>

    <p>For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops<br>
    were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another<br>
    from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious<br>
    snowball&mdash;better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest&mdash;<br>
    laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it<br>
    went wrong. The poulterers&rsquo; shops were still half open, and the<br>
    fruiterers&rsquo; were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,<br>
    pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats<br>
    of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out<br>
    into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were<br>
    ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in<br>
    the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking<br>
    from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went<br>
    by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were<br>
    pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there<br>
    were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers&rsquo; benevolence<br>
    to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people&rsquo;s mouths might<br>
    water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy<br>
    and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among<br>
    the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered<br>
    leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting<br>
    off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great<br>
    compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and<br>
    beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after<br>
    dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among<br>
    these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and<br>
    stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was<br>
    something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and<br>
    round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.</p>

    <p>The Grocers&rsquo;! oh, the Grocers&rsquo;! nearly closed, with perhaps<br>
    two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such<br>
    glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the<br>
    counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller<br>
    parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled<br>
    up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended<br>
    scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even<br>
    that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so<br>
    extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,<br>
    the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and<br>
    spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on<br>
    feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs<br>
    were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in<br>
    modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that<br>
    everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but<br>
    the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful<br>
    promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other<br>
    at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left<br>
    their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to<br>
    fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in<br>
    the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people<br>
    were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which<br>
    they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,<br>
    worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws<br>
    to peck at if they chose.</p>

    <p>But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and<br>
    chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in<br>
    their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the<br>
    same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and<br>
    nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners<br>
    to the bakers&rsquo; shops. The sight of these poor revellers<br>
    appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with<br>
    Scrooge beside him in a baker&rsquo;s doorway, and taking off the<br>
    covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their<br>
    dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind<br>
    of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words<br>
    between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he<br>
    shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good<br>
    humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame<br>
    to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love<br>
    it, so it was!</p>

    <p>In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and<br>
    yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners<br>
    and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of<br>
    wet above each baker&rsquo;s oven; where the pavement smoked as<br>
    if its stones were cooking too.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from<br>
    your torch?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is. My own.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?&rdquo;<br>
    asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To any kindly given. To a poor one most.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why to a poor one most?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because it needs it most.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; said Scrooge, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;I wonder<br>
    you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should<br>
    desire to cramp these people&rsquo;s opportunities of innocent<br>
    enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You would deprive them of their means of dining every<br>
    seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said<br>
    to dine at all,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge. &ldquo;And it comes to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> seek!&rdquo; exclaimed the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your<br>
    name, or at least in that of your family,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There are some upon this earth of yours,&rdquo; returned the Spirit,<br>
    "who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,<br>
    pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness<br>
    in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and<br>
    kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge<br>
    their doings on themselves, not us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,<br>
    invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the<br>
    town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which<br>
    Scrooge had observed at the baker&rsquo;s), that notwithstanding<br>
    his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place<br>
    with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as<br>
    gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible<br>
    he could have done in any lofty hall.</p>

    <p>And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in<br>
    showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,<br>
    generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor<br>
    men, that led him straight to Scrooge&rsquo;s clerk&rsquo;s; for there he<br>
    went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and<br>
    on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped<br>
    to bless Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s dwelling with the sprinkling of his<br>
    torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; a-week<br>
    himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his<br>
    Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present<br>
    blessed his four-roomed house!</p>

    <p>Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit&rsquo;s wife, dressed out<br>
    but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,<br>
    which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and<br>
    she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of<br>
    her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter<br>
    Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and<br>
    getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob&rsquo;s private<br>
    property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the<br>
    day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly<br>
    attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.<br>
    And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing<br>
    in, screaming that outside the baker&rsquo;s they had smelt the<br>
    goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious<br>
    thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced<br>
    about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the<br>
    skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked<br>
    him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,<br>
    knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and<br>
    peeled.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What has ever got your precious father then?&rdquo; said Mrs.<br>
    Cratchit. &ldquo;And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha<br>
    warn&rsquo;t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Martha, mother!&rdquo; said a girl, appearing as she<br>
    spoke.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Martha, mother!&rdquo; cried the two young Cratchits.<br>
    "Hurrah! There&rsquo;s <i>such</i> a goose, Martha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!&rdquo;<br>
    said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off<br>
    her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d a deal of work to finish up last night,&rdquo; replied the<br>
    girl, &ldquo;and had to clear away this morning, mother!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well! Never mind so long as you are come,&rdquo; said Mrs.<br>
    Cratchit. &ldquo;Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have<br>
    a warm, Lord bless ye!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, no! There&rsquo;s father coming,&rdquo; cried the two young<br>
    Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. &ldquo;Hide, Martha,<br>
    hide!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,<br>
    with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,<br>
    hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned<br>
    up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his<br>
    shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and<br>
    had his limbs supported by an iron frame!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s our Martha?&rdquo; cried Bob Cratchit, looking<br>
    round.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not coming,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not coming!&rdquo; said Bob, with a sudden declension in his<br>
    high spirits; for he had been Tim&rsquo;s blood horse all the way<br>
    from church, and had come home rampant. &ldquo;Not coming<br>
    upon Christmas Day!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Martha didn&rsquo;t like to see him disappointed, if it were only<br>
    in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet<br>
    door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits<br>
    hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,<br>
    that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And how did little Tim behave?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Cratchit,<br>
    when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had<br>
    hugged his daughter to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;As good as gold,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and better. Somehow he<br>
    gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the<br>
    strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,<br>
    that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he<br>
    was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember<br>
    upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind<br>
    men see.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bob&rsquo;s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and<br>
    trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing<br>
    strong and hearty.</p>

    <p>His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back<br>
    came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by<br>
    his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while<br>
    Bob, turning up his cuffs&mdash;as if, poor fellow, they were<br>
    capable of being made more shabby&mdash;compounded some hot<br>
    mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round<br>
    and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,<br>
    and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the<br>
    goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.</p>

    <p>Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose<br>
    the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a<br>
    black swan was a matter of course&mdash;and in truth it was<br>
    something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made<br>
    the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;<br>
    Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;<br>
    Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted<br>
    the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny<br>
    corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for<br>
    everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard<br>
    upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest<br>
    they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be<br>
    helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was<br>
    said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.<br>
    Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared<br>
    to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the<br>
    long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of<br>
    delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,<br>
    excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with<br>
    the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!</p>

    <p>There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn&rsquo;t believe<br>
    there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and<br>
    flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal<br>
    admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,<br>
    it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as<br>
    Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small<br>
    atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn&rsquo;t ate it all at<br>
    last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest<br>
    Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to<br>
    the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss<br>
    Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone&mdash;too nervous to<br>
    bear witnesses&mdash;to take the pudding up and bring it in.</p>

    <p>Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should<br>
    break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got<br>
    over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they<br>
    were merry with the goose&mdash;a supposition at which the two<br>
    young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were<br>
    supposed.</p>

    <p>Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of<br>
    the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the<br>
    cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook&rsquo;s next<br>
    door to each other, with a laundress&rsquo;s next door to that!<br>
    That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit<br>
    entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with the pudding,<br>
    like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half<br>
    of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with<br>
    Christmas holly stuck into the top.</p>

    <p>Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly<br>
    too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by<br>
    Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that<br>
    now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had<br>
    had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had<br>
    something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it<br>
    was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have<br>
    been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed<br>
    to hint at such a thing.</p>

    <p>At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the<br>
    hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the<br>
    jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges<br>
    were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the<br>
    fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in<br>
    what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and<br>
    at Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s elbow stood the family display of glass.<br>
    Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.</p>

    <p>These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as<br>
    golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with<br>
    beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and<br>
    cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Which all the family re-echoed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God bless us every one!&rdquo; said Tiny Tim, the last of all.</p>

    <p>He sat very close to his father&rsquo;s side upon his little<br>
    stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he<br>
    loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and<br>
    dreaded that he might be taken from him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt<br>
    before, &ldquo;tell me if Tiny Tim will live.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I see a vacant seat,&rdquo; replied the Ghost, &ldquo;in the poor<br>
    chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully<br>
    preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,<br>
    the child will die.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he<br>
    will be spared.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none<br>
    other of my race,&rdquo; returned the Ghost, &ldquo;will find him here.<br>
    What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and<br>
    decrease the surplus population.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by<br>
    the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;if man you be in heart, not<br>
    adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered<br>
    What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what<br>
    men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the<br>
    sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live<br>
    than millions like this poor man&rsquo;s child. Oh God! to hear<br>
    the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life<br>
    among his hungry brothers in the dust!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge bent before the Ghost&rsquo;s rebuke, and trembling cast<br>
    his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on<br>
    hearing his own name.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Scrooge!&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the<br>
    Founder of the Feast!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Founder of the Feast indeed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cratchit,<br>
    reddening. &ldquo;I wish I had him here. I&rsquo;d give him a piece<br>
    of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he&rsquo;d have a good<br>
    appetite for it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;the children! Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;on<br>
    which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,<br>
    unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!<br>
    Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; was Bob&rsquo;s mild answer, &ldquo;Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink his health for your sake and the Day&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said<br>
    Mrs. Cratchit, &ldquo;not for his. Long life to him! A merry<br>
    Christmas and a happy new year! He&rsquo;ll be very merry and<br>
    very happy, I have no doubt!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of<br>
    their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank<br>
    it last of all, but he didn&rsquo;t care twopence for it. Scrooge<br>
    was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast<br>
    a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full<br>
    five minutes.</p>

    <p>After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than<br>
    before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done<br>
    with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his<br>
    eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full<br>
    five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed<br>
    tremendously at the idea of Peter&rsquo;s being a man of business;<br>
    and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from<br>
    between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular<br>
    investments he should favour when he came into the receipt<br>
    of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor<br>
    apprentice at a milliner&rsquo;s, then told them what kind of work<br>
    she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,<br>
    and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a<br>
    good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at<br>
    home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some<br>
    days before, and how the lord &ldquo;was much about as tall as<br>
    Peter;&rdquo; at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you<br>
    couldn&rsquo;t have seen his head if you had been there. All this<br>
    time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and<br>
    by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in<br>
    the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,<br>
    and sang it very well indeed.</p>

    <p>There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not<br>
    a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes<br>
    were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;<br>
    and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside<br>
    of a pawnbroker&rsquo;s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased<br>
    with one another, and contented with the time; and when<br>
    they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings<br>
    of the Spirit&rsquo;s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon<br>
    them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.</p>

    <p>By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty<br>
    heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,<br>
    the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and<br>
    all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of<br>
    the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot<br>
    plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep<br>
    red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.<br>
    There all the children of the house were running out<br>
    into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,<br>
    uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,<br>
    were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and<br>
    there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,<br>
    and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near<br>
    neighbour&rsquo;s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw<br>
    them enter&mdash;artful witches, well they knew it&mdash;in a glow!</p>

    <p>But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on<br>
    their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought<br>
    that no one was at home to give them welcome when they<br>
    got there, instead of every house expecting company, and<br>
    piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how<br>
    the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and<br>
    opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with<br>
    a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything<br>
    within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,<br>
    dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was<br>
    dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly<br>
    as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter<br>
    that he had any company but Christmas!</p>

    <p>And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they<br>
    stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses<br>
    of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place<br>
    of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,<br>
    or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;<br>
    and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.<br>
    Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery<br>
    red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a<br>
    sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in<br>
    the thick gloom of darkest night.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of<br>
    the earth,&rdquo; returned the Spirit. &ldquo;But they know me. See!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they<br>
    advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and<br>
    stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a<br>
    glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their<br>
    children and their children&rsquo;s children, and another generation<br>
    beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.<br>
    The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling<br>
    of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a<br>
    Christmas song&mdash;it had been a very old song when he was a<br>
    boy&mdash;and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.<br>
    So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite<br>
    blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour<br>
    sank again.</p>

    <p>The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his<br>
    robe, and passing on above the moor, sped&mdash;whither? Not<br>
    to sea? To sea. To Scrooge&rsquo;s horror, looking back, he saw<br>
    the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;<br>
    and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it<br>
    rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it<br>
    had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.</p>

    <p>Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league<br>
    or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,<br>
    the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.<br>
    Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds<br>
    &mdash;born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the<br>
    water&mdash;rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.</p>

    <p>But even here, two men who watched the light had made<br>
    a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed<br>
    out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their<br>
    horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they<br>
    wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and<br>
    one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and<br>
    scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship<br>
    might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in<br>
    itself.</p>

    <p>Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea<br>
    &mdash;on, on&mdash;until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any<br>
    shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman<br>
    at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who<br>
    had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;<br>
    but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or<br>
    had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his<br>
    companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward<br>
    hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or<br>
    sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another<br>
    on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared<br>
    to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those<br>
    he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted<br>
    to remember him.</p>

    <p>It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the<br>
    moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it<br>
    was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown<br>
    abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it<br>
    was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear<br>
    a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge<br>
    to recognise it as his own nephew&rsquo;s and to find himself in a<br>
    bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling<br>
    by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving<br>
    affability!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a<br>
    man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, all I can<br>
    say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,<br>
    and I&rsquo;ll cultivate his acquaintance.</p>

    <p>It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that<br>
    while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing<br>
    in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and<br>
    good-humour. When Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew laughed in this way: holding<br>
    his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the<br>
    most extravagant contortions: Scrooge&rsquo;s niece, by marriage,<br>
    laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being<br>
    not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!&rdquo; cried<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;He believed it too!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;More shame for him, Fred!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s niece,<br>
    indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by<br>
    halves. They are always in earnest.</p>

    <p>She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,<br>
    surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that<br>
    seemed made to be kissed&mdash;as no doubt it was; all kinds of<br>
    good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another<br>
    when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever<br>
    saw in any little creature&rsquo;s head. Altogether she was what<br>
    you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.<br>
    Oh, perfectly satisfactory.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a comical old fellow,&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s<br>
    the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,<br>
    his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing<br>
    to say against him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is very rich, Fred,&rdquo; hinted Scrooge&rsquo;s niece.<br>
    "At least you always tell <i>me</i> so.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What of that, my dear!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;His<br>
    wealth is of no use to him. He don&rsquo;t do any good with it.<br>
    He don&rsquo;t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn&rsquo;t the<br>
    satisfaction of thinking&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;that he is ever going<br>
    to benefit US with it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have no patience with him,&rdquo; observed Scrooge&rsquo;s niece.<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s niece&rsquo;s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed<br>
    the same opinion.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, I have!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;I am sorry for<br>
    him; I couldn&rsquo;t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers<br>
    by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into<br>
    his head to dislike us, and he won&rsquo;t come and dine with us.<br>
    What&rsquo;s the consequence? He don&rsquo;t lose much of a dinner.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,&rdquo; interrupted<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they<br>
    must be allowed to have been competent judges, because<br>
    they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the<br>
    table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew,<br>
    "because I haven&rsquo;t great faith in these young housekeepers.<br>
    What do <i>you</i> say, Topper?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge&rsquo;s niece&rsquo;s<br>
    sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,<br>
    who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.<br>
    Whereat Scrooge&rsquo;s niece&rsquo;s sister&mdash;the plump one with the lace<br>
    tucker: not the one with the roses&mdash;blushed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do go on, Fred,&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s niece, clapping her hands.<br>
    "He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a<br>
    ridiculous fellow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was<br>
    impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister<br>
    tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was<br>
    unanimously followed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was only going to say,&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, &ldquo;that<br>
    the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making<br>
    merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant<br>
    moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses<br>
    pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,<br>
    either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I<br>
    mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he<br>
    likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas<br>
    till he dies, but he can&rsquo;t help thinking better of it&mdash;I defy<br>
    him&mdash;if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after<br>
    year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only<br>
    puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,<br>
    <i>that&rsquo;s</i> something; and I think I shook him yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking<br>
    Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much<br>
    caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any<br>
    rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the<br>
    bottle joyously.</p>

    <p>After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical<br>
    family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a<br>
    Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who<br>
    could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never<br>
    swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face<br>
    over it. Scrooge&rsquo;s niece played well upon the harp; and<br>
    played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:<br>
    you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had<br>
    been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the<br>
    boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of<br>
    Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the<br>
    things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he<br>
    softened more and more; and thought that if he could have<br>
    listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the<br>
    kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,<br>
    without resorting to the sexton&rsquo;s spade that buried Jacob<br>
    Marley.</p>

    <p>But they didn&rsquo;t devote the whole evening to music. After<br>
    a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children<br>
    sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its<br>
    mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first<br>
    a game at blind-man&rsquo;s buff. Of course there was. And I<br>
    no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he<br>
    had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done<br>
    thing between him and Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew; and that the<br>
    Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after<br>
    that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the<br>
    credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,<br>
    tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,<br>
    smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,<br>
    there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.<br>
    He wouldn&rsquo;t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up<br>
    against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would<br>
    have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would<br>
    have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly<br>
    have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.<br>
    She often cried out that it wasn&rsquo;t fair; and it really was not.<br>
    But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her<br>
    silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got<br>
    her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his<br>
    conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to<br>
    know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her<br>
    head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by<br>
    pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain<br>
    about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told<br>
    him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in<br>
    office, they were so very confidential together, behind the<br>
    curtains.</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s niece was not one of the blind-man&rsquo;s buff party,<br>
    but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,<br>
    in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close<br>
    behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her<br>
    love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.<br>
    Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was<br>
    very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, beat<br>
    her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper<br>
    could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,<br>
    young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for<br>
    wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that<br>
    his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with<br>
    his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;<br>
    for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut<br>
    in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in<br>
    his head to be.</p>

    <p>The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,<br>
    and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like<br>
    a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But<br>
    this the Spirit said could not be done.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Here is a new game,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;One half hour,<br>
    Spirit, only one!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew<br>
    had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;<br>
    he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case<br>
    was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,<br>
    elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live<br>
    animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an<br>
    animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,<br>
    and lived in London, and walked about the streets,<br>
    and wasn&rsquo;t made a show of, and wasn&rsquo;t led by anybody, and<br>
    didn&rsquo;t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,<br>
    and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a<br>
    tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh<br>
    question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a<br>
    fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that<br>
    he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last<br>
    the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know<br>
    what it is!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Fred.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal<br>
    sentiment, though some objected that the reply to &ldquo;Is it a<br>
    bear?&rdquo; ought to have been &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; inasmuch as an answer<br>
    in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts<br>
    from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency<br>
    that way.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,&rdquo; said<br>
    Fred, &ldquo;and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.<br>
    Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the<br>
    moment; and I say, &lsquo;Uncle Scrooge!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well! Uncle Scrooge!&rdquo; they cried.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old<br>
    man, whatever he is!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t<br>
    take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle<br>
    Scrooge!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light<br>
    of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious<br>
    company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,<br>
    if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene<br>
    passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his<br>
    nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.</p>

    <p>Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they<br>
    visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood<br>
    beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,<br>
    and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they<br>
    were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was<br>
    rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery&rsquo;s every<br>
    refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not<br>
    made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his<br>
    blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.</p>

    <p>It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge<br>
    had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared<br>
    to be condensed into the space of time they passed<br>
    together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained<br>
    unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly<br>
    older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of<br>
    it, until they left a children&rsquo;s Twelfth Night party, when,<br>
    looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,<br>
    he noticed that its hair was grey.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are spirits&rsquo; lives so short?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My life upon this globe, is very brief,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.<br>
    "It ends to-night.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; cried Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing<br>
    near.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at<br>
    that moment.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit&rsquo;s robe, &ldquo;but I see<br>
    something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding<br>
    from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,&rdquo; was<br>
    the Spirit&rsquo;s sorrowful reply. &ldquo;Look here.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;<br>
    wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt<br>
    down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!&rdquo; exclaimed<br>
    the Ghost.</p>

    <p>They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,<br>
    wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where<br>
    graceful youth should have filled their features out, and<br>
    touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled<br>
    hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and<br>
    pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat<br>
    enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No<br>
    change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any<br>
    grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has<br>
    monsters half so horrible and dread.</p>

    <p>Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to<br>
    him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but<br>
    the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie<br>
    of such enormous magnitude.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit! are they yours?&rdquo; Scrooge could say no more.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They are Man&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the Spirit, looking down upon<br>
    them. &ldquo;And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.<br>
    This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,<br>
    and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for<br>
    on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the<br>
    writing be erased. Deny it!&rdquo; cried the Spirit, stretching out<br>
    its hand towards the city. &ldquo;Slander those who tell it ye!<br>
    Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.<br>
    And bide the end!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have they no refuge or resource?&rdquo; cried Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are there no prisons?&rdquo; said the Spirit, turning on him<br>
    for the last time with his own words. &ldquo;Are there no workhouses?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The bell struck twelve.</p>

    <p>Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.<br>
    As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the<br>
    prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes,<br>
    beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like<br>
    a mist along the ground, towards him.</p>

    <h2 id="stave4">STAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS</h2>

    <p>THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When<br>
    it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in<br>
    the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to<br>
    scatter gloom and mystery.</p>

    <p>It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed<br>
    its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible<br>
    save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been<br>
    difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it<br>
    from the darkness by which it was surrounded.</p>

    <p>He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside<br>
    him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a<br>
    solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither<br>
    spoke nor moved.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To<br>
    Come?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its<br>
    hand.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are about to show me shadows of the things that<br>
    have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,&rdquo;<br>
    Scrooge pursued. &ldquo;Is that so, Spirit?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an<br>
    instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.<br>
    That was the only answer he received.</p>

    <p>Although well used to ghostly company by this time,<br>
    Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled<br>
    beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when<br>
    he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as<br>
    observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.</p>

    <p>But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him<br>
    with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the<br>
    dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon<br>
    him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,<br>
    could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap<br>
    of black.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ghost of the Future!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I fear you more<br>
    than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose<br>
    is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another<br>
    man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,<br>
    and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak<br>
    to me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight<br>
    before them.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Lead on! The night is<br>
    waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead<br>
    on, Spirit!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.<br>
    Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him<br>
    up, he thought, and carried him along.</p>

    <p>They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather<br>
    seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its<br>
    own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on<br>
    &rsquo;Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,<br>
    and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in<br>
    groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully<br>
    with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had<br>
    seen them often.</p>

    <p>The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.<br>
    Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge<br>
    advanced to listen to their talk.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, &ldquo;I<br>
    don&rsquo;t know much about it, either way. I only know he&rsquo;s<br>
    dead.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When did he die?&rdquo; inquired another.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Last night, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, what was the matter with him?&rdquo; asked a third,<br>
    taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.<br>
    "I thought he&rsquo;d never die.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said the first, with a yawn.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What has he done with his money?&rdquo; asked a red-faced<br>
    gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his<br>
    nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; said the man with the large chin,<br>
    yawning again. &ldquo;Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn&rsquo;t<br>
    left it to <i>me</i>. That&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely to be a very cheap funeral,&rdquo; said the same<br>
    speaker; &ldquo;for upon my life I don&rsquo;t know of anybody to go<br>
    to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind going if a lunch is provided,&rdquo; observed the<br>
    gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. &ldquo;But I must<br>
    be fed, if I make one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Another laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,&rdquo;<br>
    said the first speaker, &ldquo;for I never wear black gloves, and I<br>
    never eat lunch. But I&rsquo;ll offer to go, if anybody else will.<br>
    When I come to think of it, I&rsquo;m not at all sure that I wasn&rsquo;t<br>
    his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak<br>
    whenever we met. Bye, bye!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with<br>
    other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the<br>
    Spirit for an explanation.</p>

    <p>The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed<br>
    to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking<br>
    that the explanation might lie here.</p>

    <p>He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:<br>
    very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point<br>
    always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point<br>
    of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; returned the other.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Old Scratch has got his own at<br>
    last, hey?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So I am told,&rdquo; returned the second. &ldquo;Cold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Seasonable for Christmas time. You&rsquo;re not a skater, I<br>
    suppose?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Not another word. That was their meeting, their<br>
    conversation, and their parting.</p>

    <p>Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the<br>
    Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so<br>
    trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden<br>
    purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.<br>
    They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the<br>
    death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this<br>
    Ghost&rsquo;s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any<br>
    one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could<br>
    apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they<br>
    applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,<br>
    he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,<br>
    and everything he saw; and especially to observe the<br>
    shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation<br>
    that the conduct of his future self would give him<br>
    the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these<br>
    riddles easy.</p>

    <p>He looked about in that very place for his own image; but<br>
    another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the<br>
    clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he<br>
    saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured<br>
    in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;<br>
    for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and<br>
    thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried<br>
    out in this.</p>

    <p>Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its<br>
    outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his<br>
    thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and<br>
    its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes<br>
    were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel<br>
    very cold.</p>

    <p>They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part<br>
    of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,<br>
    although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The<br>
    ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;<br>
    the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and<br>
    archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of<br>
    smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the<br>
    whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.</p>

    <p>Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,<br>
    beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,<br>
    bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor<br>
    within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,<br>
    files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets<br>
    that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in<br>
    mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and<br>
    sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a<br>
    charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,<br>
    nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the<br>
    cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous<br>
    tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury<br>
    of calm retirement.</p>

    <p>Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this<br>
    man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the<br>
    shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,<br>
    similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by<br>
    a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight<br>
    of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each<br>
    other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which<br>
    the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three<br>
    burst into a laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let the charwoman alone to be the first!&rdquo; cried she who<br>
    had entered first. &ldquo;Let the laundress alone to be the second;<br>
    and let the undertaker&rsquo;s man alone to be the third. Look<br>
    here, old Joe, here&rsquo;s a chance! If we haven&rsquo;t all three met<br>
    here without meaning it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have met in a better place,&rdquo; said old Joe,<br>
    removing his pipe from his mouth. &ldquo;Come into the parlour.<br>
    You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other<br>
    two an&rsquo;t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.<br>
    Ah! How it skreeks! There an&rsquo;t such a rusty bit of metal<br>
    in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s<br>
    no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We&rsquo;re all suitable<br>
    to our calling, we&rsquo;re well matched. Come into the<br>
    parlour. Come into the parlour.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The<br>
    old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and<br>
    having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the<br>
    stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.</p>

    <p>While he did this, the woman who had already spoken<br>
    threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting<br>
    manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and<br>
    looking with a bold defiance at the other two.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?&rdquo; said the<br>
    woman. &ldquo;Every person has a right to take care of themselves.<br>
    <i>He</i> always did.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, indeed!&rdquo; said the laundress. &ldquo;No man<br>
    more so.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why then, don&rsquo;t stand staring as if you was afraid,<br>
    woman; who&rsquo;s the wiser? We&rsquo;re not going to pick holes in<br>
    each other&rsquo;s coats, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.<br>
    "We should hope not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.<br>
    Who&rsquo;s the worse for the loss of a few things like these?<br>
    Not a dead man, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If he wanted to keep &rsquo;em after he was dead, a wicked old<br>
    screw,&rdquo; pursued the woman, &ldquo;why wasn&rsquo;t he natural in his<br>
    lifetime? If he had been, he&rsquo;d have had somebody to look<br>
    after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying<br>
    gasping out his last there, alone by himself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truest word that ever was spoke,&rdquo; said Mrs.<br>
    Dilber. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a judgment on him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish it was a little heavier judgment,&rdquo; replied the<br>
    woman; &ldquo;and it should have been, you may depend upon it,<br>
    if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that<br>
    bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out<br>
    plain. I&rsquo;m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to<br>
    see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,<br>
    before we met here, I believe. It&rsquo;s no sin. Open the bundle,<br>
    Joe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;<br>
    and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,<br>
    produced <i>his</i> plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,<br>
    a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no<br>
    great value, were all. They were severally examined and<br>
    appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed<br>
    to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a<br>
    total when he found there was nothing more to come.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your account,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t give<br>
    another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.<br>
    Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing<br>
    apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of<br>
    sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall<br>
    in the same manner.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I always give too much to ladies. It&rsquo;s a weakness of mine,<br>
    and that&rsquo;s the way I ruin myself,&rdquo; said old Joe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s<br>
    your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made<br>
    it an open question, I&rsquo;d repent of being so liberal and knock<br>
    off half-a-crown.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now undo <i>my</i> bundle, Joe,&rdquo; said the first woman.</p>

    <p>Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience<br>
    of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,<br>
    dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you call this?&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Bed-curtains!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward<br>
    on her crossed arms. &ldquo;Bed-curtains!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you took &rsquo;em down, rings and<br>
    all, with him lying there?&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes I do,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You were born to make your fortune,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and<br>
    you&rsquo;ll certainly do it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I certainly shan&rsquo;t hold my hand, when I can get anything<br>
    in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He<br>
    was, I promise you, Joe,&rdquo; returned the woman coolly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t<br>
    drop that oil upon the blankets, now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;His blankets?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Whose else&rsquo;s do you think?&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;He<br>
    isn&rsquo;t likely to take cold without &rsquo;em, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hope he didn&rsquo;t die of anything catching? Eh?&rdquo; said<br>
    old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid of that,&rdquo; returned the woman. &ldquo;I<br>
    an&rsquo;t so fond of his company that I&rsquo;d loiter about him for<br>
    such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that<br>
    shirt till your eyes ache; but you won&rsquo;t find a hole in it, nor<br>
    a threadbare place. It&rsquo;s the best he had, and a fine one too.<br>
    They&rsquo;d have wasted it, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you call wasting of it?&rdquo; asked old Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,&rdquo; replied<br>
    the woman with a laugh. &ldquo;Somebody was fool enough to<br>
    do it, but I took it off again. If calico an&rsquo;t good enough for<br>
    such a purpose, it isn&rsquo;t good enough for anything. It&rsquo;s quite<br>
    as becoming to the body. He can&rsquo;t look uglier than he did<br>
    in that one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat<br>
    grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by<br>
    the old man&rsquo;s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and<br>
    disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they<br>
    had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the same woman, when old Joe,<br>
    producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their<br>
    several gains upon the ground. &ldquo;This is the end of it, you<br>
    see! He frightened every one away from him when he was<br>
    alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. &ldquo;I<br>
    see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.<br>
    My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is<br>
    this!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now<br>
    he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,<br>
    beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,<br>
    which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful<br>
    language.</p>

    <p>The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with<br>
    any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience<br>
    to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it<br>
    was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon<br>
    the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,<br>
    uncared for, was the body of this man.</p>

    <p>Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand<br>
    was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted<br>
    that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon<br>
    Scrooge&rsquo;s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought<br>
    of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;<br>
    but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss<br>
    the spectre at his side.</p>

    <p>Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar<br>
    here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy<br>
    command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,<br>
    revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair<br>
    to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is<br>
    not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;<br>
    it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the<br>
    hand <font style="font-variant: small-caps">was</font> open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,<br>
    and tender; and the pulse a man&rsquo;s. Strike, Shadow, strike!<br>
    And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow<br>
    the world with life immortal!</p>

    <p>No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge&rsquo;s ears, and<br>
    yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He<br>
    thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be<br>
    his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?<br>
    They have brought him to a rich end, truly!</p>

    <p>He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a<br>
    woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this<br>
    or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be<br>
    kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was<br>
    a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What<br>
    <i>they</i> wanted in the room of death, and why they were so<br>
    restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is a fearful place. In leaving it,<br>
    I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the<br>
    head.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; Scrooge returned, &ldquo;and I would do<br>
    it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have<br>
    not the power.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Again it seemed to look upon him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion<br>
    caused by this man&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Scrooge quite agonised,<br>
    "show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a<br>
    moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room<br>
    by daylight, where a mother and her children were.</p>

    <p>She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;<br>
    for she walked up and down the room; started at every<br>
    sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;<br>
    tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly<br>
    bear the voices of the children in their play.</p>

    <p>At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried<br>
    to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was<br>
    careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was<br>
    a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight<br>
    of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.</p>

    <p>He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for<br>
    him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news<br>
    (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared<br>
    embarrassed how to answer.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or bad?"&mdash;to help him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are quite ruined?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. There is hope yet, Caroline.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If <i>he</i> relents,&rdquo; she said, amazed, &ldquo;there is! Nothing is<br>
    past hope, if such a miracle has happened.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He is past relenting,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke<br>
    truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she<br>
    said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next<br>
    moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of<br>
    her heart.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last<br>
    night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a<br>
    week&rsquo;s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid<br>
    me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only<br>
    very ill, but dying, then.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To whom will our debt be transferred?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But before that time we shall be ready<br>
    with the money; and even though we were not, it would be<br>
    a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his<br>
    successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.<br>
    The children&rsquo;s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what<br>
    they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier<br>
    house for this man&rsquo;s death! The only emotion that the<br>
    Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of<br>
    pleasure.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge; &ldquo;or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just<br>
    now, will be for ever present to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar<br>
    to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and<br>
    there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They<br>
    entered poor Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s house; the dwelling he had<br>
    visited before; and found the mother and the children seated<br>
    round the fire.</p>

    <p>Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as<br>
    still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,<br>
    who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters<br>
    were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;And He took a child, and set him in the midst of<br>
    them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not<br>
    dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he<br>
    and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not<br>
    go on?</p>

    <p>The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her<br>
    hand up to her face.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The colour hurts my eyes,&rdquo; she said.</p>

    <p>The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re better now again,&rdquo; said Cratchit&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;It<br>
    makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn&rsquo;t show weak<br>
    eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It<br>
    must be near his time.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Past it rather,&rdquo; Peter answered, shutting up his book.<br>
    "But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,<br>
    these few last evenings, mother.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a<br>
    steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have known him walk with&mdash;I have known him walk<br>
    with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Often.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; exclaimed another. So had all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But he was very light to carry,&rdquo; she resumed, intent upon<br>
    her work, &ldquo;and his father loved him so, that it was no<br>
    trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter<br>
    &mdash;he had need of it, poor fellow&mdash;came in. His tea<br>
    was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should<br>
    help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got<br>
    upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against<br>
    his face, as if they said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it, father. Don&rsquo;t be<br>
    grieved!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to<br>
    all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and<br>
    praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.<br>
    They would be done long before Sunday, he said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?&rdquo; said his<br>
    wife.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; returned Bob. &ldquo;I wish you could have<br>
    gone. It would have done you good to see how green a<br>
    place it is. But you&rsquo;ll see it often. I promised him that I<br>
    would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!&rdquo;<br>
    cried Bob. &ldquo;My little child!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He broke down all at once. He couldn&rsquo;t help it. If he<br>
    could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther<br>
    apart perhaps than they were.</p>

    <p>He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,<br>
    which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.<br>
    There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were<br>
    signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat<br>
    down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed<br>
    himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what<br>
    had happened, and went down again quite happy.</p>

    <p>They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother<br>
    working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness<br>
    of Mr. Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but<br>
    once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing<br>
    that he looked a little&mdash;"just a little down you know,&rdquo; said<br>
    Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. &ldquo;On<br>
    which,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman<br>
    you ever heard, I told him. &lsquo;I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.<br>
    Cratchit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and heartily sorry for your good wife.&rsquo;<br>
    By the bye, how he ever knew <i>that</i>, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Knew what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, that you were a good wife,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Everybody knows that!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Very well observed, my boy!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;I hope they<br>
    do. &lsquo;Heartily sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for your good wife. If I<br>
    can be of service to you in any way,&rsquo; he said, giving me<br>
    his card, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where I live. Pray come to me.&rsquo; Now, it<br>
    wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Bob, &ldquo;for the sake of anything he might be<br>
    able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was<br>
    quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our<br>
    Tiny Tim, and felt with us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a good soul!&rdquo; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You would be surer of it, my dear,&rdquo; returned Bob, &ldquo;if<br>
    you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised&mdash;<br>
    mark what I say!&mdash;if he got Peter a better situation.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Only hear that, Peter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; cried one of the girls, &ldquo;Peter will be keeping<br>
    company with some one, and setting up for himself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Get along with you!&rdquo; retorted Peter, grinning.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as likely as not,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;one of these days;<br>
    though there&rsquo;s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however<br>
    and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we<br>
    shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim&mdash;shall we&mdash;or this<br>
    first parting that there was among us?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Never, father!&rdquo; cried they all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I know,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I know, my dears, that when<br>
    we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he<br>
    was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among<br>
    ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, never, father!&rdquo; they all cried again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; said little Bob, &ldquo;I am very happy!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the<br>
    two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook<br>
    hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from<br>
    God!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spectre,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;something informs me that our<br>
    parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not<br>
    how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as<br>
    before&mdash;though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there<br>
    seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were<br>
    in the Future&mdash;into the resorts of business men, but showed<br>
    him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,<br>
    but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,<br>
    until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This court,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;through which we hurry now,<br>
    is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length<br>
    of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,<br>
    in days to come!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The house is yonder,&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do you<br>
    point away?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The inexorable finger underwent no change.</p>

    <p>Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked<br>
    in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was<br>
    not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.<br>
    The Phantom pointed as before.</p>

    <p>He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither<br>
    he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.<br>
    He paused to look round before entering.</p>

    <p>A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name<br>
    he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a<br>
    worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and<br>
    weeds, the growth of vegetation&rsquo;s death, not life; choked up<br>
    with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A<br>
    worthy place!</p>

    <p>The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to<br>
    One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was<br>
    exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new<br>
    meaning in its solemn shape.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,&rdquo;<br>
    said Scrooge, &ldquo;answer me one question. Are these the<br>
    shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of<br>
    things that May be, only?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which<br>
    it stood.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if<br>
    persevered in, they must lead,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;But if the<br>
    courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is<br>
    thus with what you show me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit was immovable as ever.</p>

    <p>Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and<br>
    following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected<br>
    grave his own name, <font style="font-variant: small-caps">Ebenezer Scrooge</font>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Am <i>I</i> that man who lay upon the bed?&rdquo; he cried, upon<br>
    his knees.</p>

    <p>The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, Spirit! Oh no, no!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The finger still was there.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; he cried, tight clutching at its robe, &ldquo;hear me!<br>
    I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must<br>
    have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I<br>
    am past all hope!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For the first time the hand appeared to shake.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good Spirit,&rdquo; he pursued, as down upon the ground he<br>
    fell before it: &ldquo;Your nature intercedes for me, and pities<br>
    me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you<br>
    have shown me, by an altered life!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The kind hand trembled.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it<br>
    all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the<br>
    Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I<br>
    will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I<br>
    may sponge away the writing on this stone!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to<br>
    free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.<br>
    The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.</p>

    <p>Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate<br>
    reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom&rsquo;s hood and dress.<br>
    It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.</p>

    <h2 id="stave5">STAVE V:  THE END OF IT</h2>

    <p>YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,<br>
    the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time<br>
    before him was his own, to make amends in!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!&rdquo;<br>
    Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. &ldquo;The Spirits<br>
    of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley!<br>
    Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say<br>
    it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,<br>
    that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his<br>
    call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the<br>
    Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They are not torn down,&rdquo; cried Scrooge, folding one of<br>
    his bed-curtains in his arms, &ldquo;they are not torn down, rings<br>
    and all. They are here&mdash;I am here&mdash;the shadows of the<br>
    things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will<br>
    be. I know they will!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His hands were busy with his garments all this time;<br>
    turning them inside out, putting them on upside down,<br>
    tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every<br>
    kind of extravagance.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo; cried Scrooge, laughing and<br>
    crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocooen of<br>
    himself with his stockings. &ldquo;I am as light as a feather, I<br>
    am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I<br>
    am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to<br>
    everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo<br>
    here! Whoop! Hallo!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing<br>
    there: perfectly winded.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the saucepan that the gruel was in!&rdquo; cried<br>
    Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.<br>
    "There&rsquo;s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley<br>
    entered! There&rsquo;s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas<br>
    Present, sat! There&rsquo;s the window where I saw the wandering<br>
    Spirits! It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s all true, it all happened.<br>
    Ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so<br>
    many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.<br>
    The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what day of the month it is!&rdquo; said<br>
    Scrooge. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ve been among the<br>
    Spirits. I don&rsquo;t know anything. I&rsquo;m quite a baby. Never<br>
    mind. I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!<br>
    Hallo here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing<br>
    out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang,<br>
    hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang,<br>
    clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!</p>

    <p>Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his<br>
    head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold;<br>
    cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight;<br>
    Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious!<br>
    Glorious!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to-day!&rdquo; cried Scrooge, calling downward to a<br>
    boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look<br>
    about him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;<font style="font-variant: small-caps">Eh</font>?&rdquo; returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to-day, my fine fellow?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;Why, <font style="font-variant: small-caps">Christmas Day</font>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas Day!&rdquo; said Scrooge to himself. &ldquo;I<br>
    haven&rsquo;t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.<br>
    They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of<br>
    course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do you know the Poulterer&rsquo;s, in the next street but one,<br>
    at the corner?&rdquo; Scrooge inquired.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I should hope I did,&rdquo; replied the lad.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;An intelligent boy!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;A remarkable boy!<br>
    Do you know whether they&rsquo;ve sold the prize Turkey that<br>
    was hanging up there?&mdash;Not the little prize Turkey: the<br>
    big one?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What, the one as big as me?&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What a delightful boy!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure<br>
    to talk to him. Yes, my buck!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hanging there now,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Go and buy it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Walk-<font style="font-variant: small-caps">er</font>!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;I am in earnest. Go and buy<br>
    it, and tell &rsquo;em to bring it here, that I may give them the<br>
    direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and<br>
    I&rsquo;ll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than<br>
    five minutes and I&rsquo;ll give you half-a-crown!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady<br>
    hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send it to Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s!&rdquo; whispered Scrooge,<br>
    rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. &ldquo;He sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t<br>
    know who sends it. It&rsquo;s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe<br>
    Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob&rsquo;s<br>
    will be!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady<br>
    one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to<br>
    open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer&rsquo;s<br>
    man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker<br>
    caught his eye.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall love it, as long as I live!&rdquo; cried Scrooge, patting<br>
    it with his hand. &ldquo;I scarcely ever looked at it before.<br>
    What an honest expression it has in its face! It&rsquo;s a<br>
    wonderful knocker!&mdash;Here&rsquo;s the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!<br>
    How are you! Merry Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It <i>was</i> a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his<br>
    legs, that bird. He would have snapped &rsquo;em short off in a<br>
    minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,&rdquo;<br>
    said Scrooge. &ldquo;You must have a cab.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with<br>
    which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which<br>
    he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed<br>
    the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle<br>
    with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and<br>
    chuckled till he cried.</p>

    <p>Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to<br>
    shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when<br>
    you don&rsquo;t dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the<br>
    end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of<br>
    sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.</p>

    <p>He dressed himself &ldquo;all in his best,&rdquo; and at last got out<br>
    into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,<br>
    as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;<br>
    and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded<br>
    every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly<br>
    pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows<br>
    said, &ldquo;Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!&rdquo;<br>
    And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe<br>
    sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.</p>

    <p>He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he<br>
    beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his<br>
    counting-house the day before, and said, &ldquo;Scrooge and Marley&rsquo;s, I<br>
    believe?&rdquo;  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this<br>
    old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he<br>
    knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and<br>
    taking the old gentleman by both his hands. &ldquo;How do you<br>
    do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of<br>
    you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Scrooge?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;That is my name, and I fear it<br>
    may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.<br>
    And will you have the goodness"&mdash;here Scrooge whispered in<br>
    his ear.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Lord bless me!&rdquo; cried the gentleman, as if his breath<br>
    were taken away. &ldquo;My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Not a farthing less. A<br>
    great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.<br>
    Will you do me that favour?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the other, shaking hands with him.<br>
    "I don&rsquo;t know what to say to such munifi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything, please,&rdquo; retorted Scrooge. &ldquo;Come<br>
    and see me. Will you come and see me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he<br>
    meant to do it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I am much obliged to you.<br>
    I thank you fifty times. Bless you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He went to church, and walked about the streets, and<br>
    watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children<br>
    on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into<br>
    the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found<br>
    that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never<br>
    dreamed that any walk&mdash;that anything&mdash;could give him so<br>
    much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps<br>
    towards his nephew&rsquo;s house.</p>

    <p>He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the<br>
    courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and<br>
    did it:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is your master at home, my dear?&rdquo; said Scrooge to the<br>
    girl. Nice girl! Very.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Where is he, my love?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I&rsquo;ll<br>
    show you up-stairs, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee. He knows me,&rdquo; said Scrooge, with his hand<br>
    already on the dining-room lock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in here, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.<br>
    They were looking at the table (which was spread out in<br>
    great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous<br>
    on such points, and like to see that everything is right.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Fred!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!<br>
    Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting<br>
    in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have done<br>
    it, on any account.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why bless my soul!&rdquo; cried Fred, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.<br>
    Will you let me in, Fred?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Let him in! It is a mercy he didn&rsquo;t shake his arm off.<br>
    He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.<br>
    His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when <i>he</i><br>
    came. So did the plump sister when <i>she</i> came. So did<br>
    every one when <i>they</i> came. Wonderful party, wonderful<br>
    games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!</p>

    <p>But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was<br>
    early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob<br>
    Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his<br>
    heart upon.</p>

    <p>And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No<br>
    Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen<br>
    minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his<br>
    door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.</p>

    <p>His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter<br>
    too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his<br>
    pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as<br>
    near as he could feign it. &ldquo;What do you mean by coming<br>
    here at this time of day?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> behind my time.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo; repeated Scrooge. &ldquo;Yes. I think you are.<br>
    Step this way, sir, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only once a year, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Bob, appearing from<br>
    the Tank. &ldquo;It shall not be repeated. I was making rather<br>
    merry yesterday, sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my friend,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;I<br>
    am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And<br>
    therefore,&rdquo; he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving<br>
    Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into<br>
    the Tank again; &ldquo;and therefore I am about to raise your<br>
    salary!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He<br>
    had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,<br>
    holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help<br>
    and a strait-waistcoat.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A merry Christmas, Bob!&rdquo; said Scrooge, with an earnestness<br>
    that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the<br>
    back. &ldquo;A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I<br>
    have given you, for many a year! I&rsquo;ll raise your salary, and<br>
    endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss<br>
    your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of<br>
    smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another<br>
    coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>
    Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and<br>
    infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did <font style="font-variant: small-caps">not</font> die, he was<br>
    a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a<br>
    master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or<br>
    any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old<br>
    world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,<br>
    but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was<br>
    wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this<br>
    globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill<br>
    of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these<br>
    would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they<br>
    should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in<br>
    less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was<br>
    quite enough for him.</p>

    <p>He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon<br>
    the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was<br>
    always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas<br>
    well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that<br>
    be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim<br>
    observed, God bless Us, Every One!</p>

    <h4>THE END.</h4>
