        <p><font style="font-variant: small-caps">I have</font> endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,
        to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my
        readers out of humour with themselves, with each other,

        pleasantly, and no one wish to <span class="definition">lay<span class="definition-text"><i>archaic</i> v. to bury; to dispose of.</span></span> it.</p>

        <h2 id="stave1">STAVE I:  MARLEY&rsquo;S GHOST</h2>

        <p>MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
        whatever about that. The register of his burial was
        signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
        and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
        Scrooge&rsquo;s name was good upon &rsquo;Change, for anything he
        chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
        door-nail.</p>

        <p>Mind! I don&rsquo;t mean to say that I know, of my
        own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
        a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
        regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
        in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
        is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands
        shall not disturb it, or the Country&rsquo;s done for. You
        will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that
        Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</p>

        <p>Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.
        How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were
        partners for I don&rsquo;t know how many years. Scrooge
        was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole
        assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and
        sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully
        cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
        man of business on the very day of the funeral,
        and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.</p>

        <p>The mention of Marley&rsquo;s funeral brings me back to
        the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley
        was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or
        nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going
        to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that
        Hamlet&rsquo;s Father died before the play began, there
        would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a
        stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
        than there would be in any other middle-aged
        gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
        spot&mdash;say Saint Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard for 
        instance&mdash;literally to astonish his son&rsquo;s weak mind.</p>

        <p>Scrooge never painted out Old Marley&rsquo;s name.
        There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse
        door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as
        Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the
        business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
        but he answered to both names. It was all the
        same to him.</p>

        <p>Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,
        Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,
        clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,
        from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;
        secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The
        cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
        nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his
        eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his
        grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his
        eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low
        temperature always about with him; he iced his office in
        the dog-days; and didn&rsquo;t thaw it one degree at Christmas.</p>

        <p>External heat and cold had little influence on
        Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather
        chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,
        no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no
        pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn&rsquo;t
        know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and
        snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage
        over him in only one respect. They often &ldquo;came down&rdquo;
        handsomely, and Scrooge never did.</p>

        <p>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with
        gladsome looks, &ldquo;My dear Scrooge, how are you?
        When will you come to see me?&rdquo; No beggars implored
        him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him
        what it was o&rsquo;clock, no man or woman ever once in all
        his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of
        Scrooge. Even the blind men&rsquo;s dogs appeared to
        know him; and when they saw him coming on, would
        tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and
        then would wag their tails as though they said, &ldquo;No
        eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing
        he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths
        of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,
        was what the knowing ones call &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; to Scrooge.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time&mdash;of all the good days in the year,
        on Christmas Eve&mdash;old Scrooge sat busy in his
        counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy
        withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,
        go wheezing up and down, beating their hands
        upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the
        pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had
        only just gone three, but it was quite dark already&mdash;it 
        had not been light all day&mdash;and candles were flaring
        in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like
        ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog
        came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was
        so dense without, that although the court was of the
        narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
        To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring
        everything, one might have thought that Nature
        lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.</p>

        <p>The door of Scrooge&rsquo;s counting-house was open
        that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a
        dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying
        letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk&rsquo;s
        fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
        coal. But he couldn&rsquo;t replenish it, for Scrooge kept
        the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the
        clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted
        that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore
        the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to
        warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being
        a man of a strong imagination, he failed.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!&rdquo; cried
        a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge&rsquo;s
        nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was
        the first intimation he had of his approach.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
        fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge&rsquo;s, that he was
        all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his
        eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Christmas a humbug, uncle!&rdquo; said Scrooge&rsquo;s
        nephew. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, I am sure?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Merry Christmas! What
        right have you to be merry? What reason have you
        to be merry? You&rsquo;re poor enough.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; returned the nephew gaily. &ldquo;What
        right have you to be dismal? What reason have you
        to be morose? You&rsquo;re rich enough.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur
        of the moment, said, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; again; and followed it up
        with &ldquo;Humbug.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, uncle!&rdquo; said the nephew.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What else can I be,&rdquo; returned the uncle, &ldquo;when I
        live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!
        Out upon merry Christmas! What&rsquo;s Christmas
        time to you but a time for paying bills without
        money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but
        not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books
        and having every item in &lsquo;em through a round dozen
        of months presented dead against you? If I could
        work my will,&rdquo; said Scrooge indignantly, &ldquo;every idiot
        who goes about with &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; on his lips,
        should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried
        with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; pleaded the nephew.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; returned the uncle sternly, &ldquo;keep Christmas
        in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Keep it!&rdquo; repeated Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;But you
        don&rsquo;t keep it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Let me leave it alone, then,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Much
        good may it do you! Much good it has ever done
        you!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;There are many things from which I might have
        derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare
        say,&rdquo; returned the nephew. &ldquo;Christmas among the
        rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas
        time, when it has come round&mdash;apart from the
        veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything
        belonging to it can be apart from that&mdash;as a
        good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
        time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar
        of the year, when men and women seem by one consent
        to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think
        of people below them as if they really were
        fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race
        of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
        uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
        silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me
        good, and <i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God bless it!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.
        Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,
        he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark
        for ever.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
        Scrooge, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll keep your Christmas by losing
        your situation! You&rsquo;re quite a powerful speaker,
        sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to his nephew. &ldquo;I wonder you
        don&rsquo;t go into Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge said that he would see him&mdash;yes, indeed he
        did. He went the whole length of the expression,
        and said that he would see him in that extremity first.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; cried Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Why did you get married?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Because I fell in love.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Because you fell in love!&rdquo; growled Scrooge, as if
        that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous
        than a merry Christmas. &ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before
        that happened. Why give it as a reason for not
        coming now?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;
        why cannot we be friends?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so
        resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I
        have been a party. But I have made the trial in
        homage to Christmas, and I&rsquo;ll keep my Christmas
        humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;And A Happy New Year!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>His nephew left the room without an angry word,
        notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to
        bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,
        cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
        them cordially.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another fellow,&rdquo; muttered Scrooge; who
        overheard him: &ldquo;my clerk, with fifteen shillings a
        week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry
        Christmas. I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>This lunatic, in letting Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew out, had
        let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,
        pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
        in Scrooge&rsquo;s office. They had books and papers in
        their hands, and bowed to him.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Scrooge and Marley&rsquo;s, I believe,&rdquo; said one of the
        gentlemen, referring to his list. &ldquo;Have I the pleasure
        of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,&rdquo;
        Scrooge replied. &ldquo;He died seven years ago, this very
        night.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We have no doubt his liberality is well represented
        by his surviving partner,&rdquo; said the gentleman, presenting
        his credentials.</p>

        <p>It certainly was; for they had been two kindred
        spirits. At the ominous word &ldquo;liberality,&rdquo; Scrooge
        frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials
        back.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&rdquo;
        said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &ldquo;it is more than
        usually desirable that we should make some slight
        provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer
        greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in
        want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands
        are in want of common comforts, sir.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Are there no prisons?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Plenty of prisons,&rdquo; said the gentleman, laying down
        the pen again.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;And the Union workhouses?&rdquo; demanded Scrooge.
        "Are they still in operation?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;They are. Still,&rdquo; returned the gentleman, &ldquo;I wish
        I could say they were not.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,
        then?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Both very busy, sir.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,
        that something had occurred to stop them in their
        useful course,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to
        hear it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
        Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,&rdquo;
        returned the gentleman, &ldquo;a few of us are endeavouring
        to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,
        and means of warmth. We choose this time, because
        it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
        and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down
        for?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Scrooge replied.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You wish to be anonymous?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I wish to be left alone,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Since you
        ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
        I don&rsquo;t make merry myself at Christmas and I can&rsquo;t
        afford to make idle people merry. I help to support
        the establishments I have mentioned&mdash;they cost
        enough; and those who are badly off must go there.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Many can&rsquo;t go there; and many would rather die.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;If they would rather die,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;they had
        better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
        Besides&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;But you might know it,&rdquo; observed the gentleman.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my business,&rdquo; Scrooge returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        enough for a man to understand his own business, and
        not to interfere with other people&rsquo;s. Mine occupies
        me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue
        their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed
        his labours with an improved opinion of himself,
        and in a more facetious temper than was usual
        with him.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that
        people ran about with flaring links, proffering their
        services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct
        them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
        whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
        at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became
        invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the
        clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if
        its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.
        The cold became intense. In the main street, at the
        corner of the court, some labourers were repairing
        the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
        round which a party of ragged men and boys were
        gathered: warming their hands and winking their
        eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
        being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,
        and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness
        of the shops where holly sprigs and berries
        crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale
        faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers&rsquo; and grocers&rsquo;
        trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,
        with which it was next to impossible to believe that
        such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything
        to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the
        mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks
        and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
        household should; and even the little tailor, whom he
        had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for
        being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up
        to-morrow&rsquo;s pudding in his garret, while his lean
        wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.</p>

        <p>Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting
        cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped
        the Evil Spirit&rsquo;s nose with a touch of such weather
        as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then
        indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The
        owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled
        by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
        stooped down at Scrooge&rsquo;s keyhole to regale him with
        a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of</p>

        <blockquote>        &ldquo;God bless you, merry gentleman!
                 May nothing you dismay!&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <p>Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,
        that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to
        the fog and even more congenial frost.</p>

        <p>At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house
        arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his
        stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant
        clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,
        and put on his hat.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?&rdquo; said
        Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;If quite convenient, sir.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not convenient,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not
        fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you&rsquo;d
        think yourself ill-used, I&rsquo;ll be bound?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The clerk smiled faintly.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think <i>me</i> ill-used,
        when I pay a day&rsquo;s wages for no work.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The clerk observed that it was only once a year.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;A poor excuse for picking a man&rsquo;s pocket every
        twenty-fifth of December!&rdquo; said Scrooge, buttoning
        his great-coat to the chin. &ldquo;But I suppose you must
        have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
        morning.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge
        walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a
        twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his
        white comforter dangling below his waist (for he
        boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,
        at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in
        honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home
        to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play
        at blindman&rsquo;s-buff.</p>

        <p>Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
        melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and
        beguiled the rest of the evening with his
        banker&rsquo;s-book, went home to bed. He lived in
        chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
        partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a
        lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so
        little business to be, that one could scarcely help
        fancying it must have run there when it was a young
        house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
        and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough
        now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but
        Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
        The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew
        its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.
        The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
        of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of
        the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
        threshold.</p>

        <p>Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all
        particular about the knocker on the door, except that it
        was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
        seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
        in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what
        is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
        London, even including&mdash;which is a bold word&mdash;the
        corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be
        borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
        thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
        seven years&rsquo; dead partner that afternoon. And then
        let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
        that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
        saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
        process of change&mdash;not a knocker, but Marley&rsquo;s face.</p>

        <p>Marley&rsquo;s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow
        as the other objects in the yard were, but had a
        dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark
        cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked
        at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly
        spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The
        hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
        and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
        motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it
        horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
        face and beyond its control, rather than a part of
        its own expression.</p>

        <p>As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it
        was a knocker again.</p>

        <p>To say that he was not startled, or that his blood
        was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
        had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.
        But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,
        turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.</p>

        <p>He <i>did</i> pause, with a moment&rsquo;s irresolution, before
        he shut the door; and he <i>did</i> look cautiously behind
        it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the
        sight of Marley&rsquo;s pigtail sticking out into the hall.
        But there was nothing on the back of the door, except
        the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he
        said &ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; and closed it with a bang.</p>

        <p>The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
        Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant&rsquo;s
        cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal
        of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to
        be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and
        walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:
        trimming his candle as he went.</p>

        <p>You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six
        up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad
        young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you
        might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken
        it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall
        and the door towards the balustrades: and done it
        easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room
        to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge
        thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before
        him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of
        the street wouldn&rsquo;t have lighted the entry too well,
        so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with
        Scrooge&rsquo;s dip.</p>

        <p>Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.
        Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before
        he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms
        to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection
        of the face to desire to do that.</p>

        <p>Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they
        should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under
        the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin
        ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had
        a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the
        bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
        which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
        against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,
        old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three
        legs, and a poker.</p>

        <p>Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked
        himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his
        custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off
        his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and
        his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take
        his gruel.</p>

        <p>It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a
        bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and
        brood over it, before he could extract the least
        sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.
        The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch
        merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint
        Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
        There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughters;
        Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending
        through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,
        Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,
        hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;
        and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came
        like the ancient Prophet&rsquo;s rod, and swallowed up the
        whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,
        with power to shape some picture on its surface from
        the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would
        have been a copy of old Marley&rsquo;s head on every one.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; said Scrooge; and walked across the
        room.</p>

        <p>After several turns, he sat down again. As he
        threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened
        to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the
        room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten
        with a chamber in the highest story of the
        building. It was with great astonishment, and with
        a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he
        saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in
        the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it
        rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.</p>

        <p>This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,
        but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had
        begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking
        noise, deep down below; as if some person were
        dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
        wine-merchant&rsquo;s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have
        heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
        dragging chains.</p>

        <p>The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,
        and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors
        below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight
        towards his door.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s humbug still!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>His colour changed though, when, without a pause,
        it came on through the heavy door, and passed into
        the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the
        dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, &ldquo;I know
        him; Marley&rsquo;s Ghost!&rdquo; and fell again.</p>

        <p>The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,
        usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on
        the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,
        and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was
        clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound
        about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge
        observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,
        ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.
        His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,
        and looking through his waistcoat, could see
        the two buttons on his coat behind.</p>

        <p>Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no
        bowels, but he had never believed it until now.</p>

        <p>No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he
        looked the phantom through and through, and saw
        it standing before him; though he felt the chilling
        influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very
        texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head
        and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;
        he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;How now!&rdquo; said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
        "What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Much!"&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s voice, no doubt about it.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Ask me who I <i>was</i>.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Who <i>were</i> you then?&rdquo; said Scrooge, raising his
        voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re particular, for a shade.&rdquo; He was going
        to say &ldquo;<i>to</i> a shade,&rdquo; but substituted this, as more
        appropriate.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Can you&mdash;can you sit down?&rdquo; asked Scrooge, looking
        doubtfully at him.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Do it, then.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge asked the question, because he didn&rsquo;t know
        whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
        a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event
        of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity
        of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat
        down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he
        were quite used to it.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in me,&rdquo; observed the Ghost.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
        your senses?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Why do you doubt your senses?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;a little thing affects them.
        A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may
        be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of
        cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There&rsquo;s more of
        gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking
        jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means
        waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be
        smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,
        and keeping down his terror; for the spectre&rsquo;s voice
        disturbed the very marrow in his bones.</p>

        <p>To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence
        for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very
        deuce with him. There was something very awful,
        too, in the spectre&rsquo;s being provided with an infernal
        atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it
        himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the
        Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,
        and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour
        from an oven.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You see this toothpick?&rdquo; said Scrooge, returning
        quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;
        and wishing, though it were only for a second, to
        divert the vision&rsquo;s stony gaze from himself.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You are not looking at it,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;But I see it,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; returned Scrooge, &ldquo;I have but to swallow
        this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a
        legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,
        I tell you! humbug!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook
        its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that
        Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself
        from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was
        his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage
        round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,
        its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!</p>

        <p>Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands
        before his face.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dreadful apparition, why do
        you trouble me?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Man of the worldly mind!&rdquo; replied the Ghost, &ldquo;do
        you believe in me or not?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;I must. But why do spirits
        walk the earth, and why do they come to me?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It is required of every man,&rdquo; the Ghost returned,
        "that the spirit within him should walk abroad among
        his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that
        spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so
        after death. It is doomed to wander through the
        world&mdash;oh, woe is me!&mdash;and witness what it cannot
        share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to
        happiness!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain
        and wrung its shadowy hands.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You are fettered,&rdquo; said Scrooge, trembling. &ldquo;Tell
        me why?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I wear the chain I forged in life,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.
        "I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded
        it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I
        wore it. Is its pattern strange to <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge trembled more and more.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Or would you know,&rdquo; pursued the Ghost, &ldquo;the
        weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?
        It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven
        Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.
        It is a ponderous chain!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the
        expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
        or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see
        nothing.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; he said, imploringly. &ldquo;Old Jacob Marley,
        tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I have none to give,&rdquo; the Ghost replied. &ldquo;It comes
        from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed
        by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor
        can I tell you what I would. A very little more is
        all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I
        cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked
        beyond our counting-house&mdash;mark me!&mdash;in life my
        spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
        money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before
        me!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became
        thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.
        Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,
        but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his
        knees.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,&rdquo;
        Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though
        with humility and deference.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Slow!&rdquo; the Ghost repeated.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Seven years dead,&rdquo; mused Scrooge. &ldquo;And travelling
        all the time!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The whole time,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;No rest, no
        peace. Incessant torture of remorse.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You travel fast?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;On the wings of the wind,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You might have got over a great quantity of
        ground in seven years,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and
        clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of
        the night, that the Ward would have been justified in
        indicting it for a nuisance.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,&rdquo; cried the
        phantom, &ldquo;not to know, that ages of incessant labour
        by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into
        eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is
        all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit
        working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may
        be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast
        means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of
        regret can make amends for one life&rsquo;s opportunity
        misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;But you were always a good man of business,
        Jacob,&rdquo; faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this
        to himself.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Business!&rdquo; cried the Ghost, wringing its hands
        again. &ldquo;Mankind was my business. The common
        welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,
        and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings
        of my trade were but a drop of water in the
        comprehensive ocean of my business!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>It held up its chain at arm&rsquo;s length, as if that were
        the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it
        heavily upon the ground again.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;At this time of the rolling year,&rdquo; the spectre said,
        "I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of
        fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never
        raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise
        Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to
        which its light would have conducted <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the
        spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake
        exceedingly.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; cried the Ghost. &ldquo;My time is nearly
        gone.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be hard upon
        me! Don&rsquo;t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;How it is that I appear before you in a shape that
        you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible
        beside you many and many a day.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,
        and wiped the perspiration from his brow.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;That is no light part of my penance,&rdquo; pursued
        the Ghost. &ldquo;I am here to-night to warn you, that you
        have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A
        chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You were always a good friend to me,&rdquo; said
        Scrooge. &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You will be haunted,&rdquo; resumed the Ghost, &ldquo;by
        Three Spirits.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s countenance fell almost as low as the
        Ghost&rsquo;s had done.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,
        Jacob?&rdquo; he demanded, in a faltering voice.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Without their visits,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;you cannot
        hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,
        when the bell tolls One.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I take &rsquo;em all at once, and have it over,
        Jacob?&rdquo; hinted Scrooge.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Expect the second on the next night at the same
        hour. The third upon the next night when the last
        stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see
        me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you
        remember what has passed between us!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>When it had said these words, the spectre took its
        wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,
        as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its
        teeth made, when the jaws were brought together
        by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,
        and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
        in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and
        about its arm.</p>

        <p>The apparition walked backward from him; and at
        every step it took, the window raised itself a little,
        so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.</p>

        <p>It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.
        When they were within two paces of each other,
        Marley&rsquo;s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to
        come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.</p>

        <p>Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:
        for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible
        of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of
        lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and
        self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,
        joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the
        bleak, dark night.</p>

        <p>Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his
        curiosity. He looked out.</p>

        <p>The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither
        and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they
        went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley&rsquo;s
        Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)
        were linked together; none were free. Many had
        been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He
        had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white
        waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to
        its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist
        a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,
        upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,
        clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in
        human matters, and had lost the power for ever.</p>

        <p>Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist
        enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and
        their spirit voices faded together; and the night became
        as it had been when he walked home.</p>

        <p>Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door
        by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,
        as he had locked it with his own hands, and
        the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say &ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo;
        but stopped at the first syllable. And being,
        from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues
        of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or
        the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of
        the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to
        bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the
        instant.</p>
