    <p>THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When
    it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in
    the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to
    scatter gloom and mystery.</p>

    <p>It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed
    its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible
    save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been
    difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it
    from the darkness by which it was surrounded.</p>

    <p>He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside
    him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a
    solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither
    spoke nor moved.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To
    Come?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its
    hand.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are about to show me shadows of the things that
    have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,&rdquo;
    Scrooge pursued. &ldquo;Is that so, Spirit?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
    instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.
    That was the only answer he received.</p>

    <p>Although well used to ghostly company by this time,
    Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled
    beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when
    he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as
    observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.</p>

    <p>But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him
    with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the
    dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
    him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,
    could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
    of black.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ghost of the Future!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I fear you more
    than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose
    is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another
    man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,
    and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak
    to me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight
    before them.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Lead on! The night is
    waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead
    on, Spirit!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.
    Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him
    up, he thought, and carried him along.</p>

    <p>They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather
    seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its
    own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on
    &rsquo;Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,
    and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in
    groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully
    with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had
    seen them often.</p>

    <p>The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.
    Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge
    advanced to listen to their talk.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know much about it, either way. I only know he&rsquo;s
    dead.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When did he die?&rdquo; inquired another.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Last night, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, what was the matter with him?&rdquo; asked a third,
    taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.
    "I thought he&rsquo;d never die.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said the first, with a yawn.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What has he done with his money?&rdquo; asked a red-faced
    gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his
    nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; said the man with the large chin,
    yawning again. &ldquo;Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn&rsquo;t
    left it to <i>me</i>. That&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely to be a very cheap funeral,&rdquo; said the same
    speaker; &ldquo;for upon my life I don&rsquo;t know of anybody to go
    to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind going if a lunch is provided,&rdquo; observed the
    gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. &ldquo;But I must
    be fed, if I make one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Another laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,&rdquo;
    said the first speaker, &ldquo;for I never wear black gloves, and I
    never eat lunch. But I&rsquo;ll offer to go, if anybody else will.
    When I come to think of it, I&rsquo;m not at all sure that I wasn&rsquo;t
    his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak
    whenever we met. Bye, bye!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with
    other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the
    Spirit for an explanation.</p>

    <p>The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed
    to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking
    that the explanation might lie here.</p>

    <p>He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:
    very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point
    always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point
    of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; returned the other.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Old Scratch has got his own at
    last, hey?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So I am told,&rdquo; returned the second. &ldquo;Cold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Seasonable for Christmas time. You&rsquo;re not a skater, I
    suppose?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Not another word. That was their meeting, their
    conversation, and their parting.</p>

    <p>Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the
    Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so
    trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden
    purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.
    They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the
    death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this
    Ghost&rsquo;s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any
    one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could
    apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they
    applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,
    he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,
    and everything he saw; and especially to observe the
    shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation
    that the conduct of his future self would give him
    the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these
    riddles easy.</p>

    <p>He looked about in that very place for his own image; but
    another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the
    clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he
    saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured
    in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;
    for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and
    thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried
    out in this.</p>

    <p>Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its
    outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his
    thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and
    its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes
    were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel
    very cold.</p>

    <p>They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part
    of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,
    although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The
    ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;
    the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and
    archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of
    smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the
    whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.</p>

    <p>Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,
    beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,
    bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor
    within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,
    files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets
    that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in
    mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and
    sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a
    charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,
    nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the
    cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous
    tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury
    of calm retirement.</p>

    <p>Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this
    man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the
    shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,
    similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by
    a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight
    of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each
    other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which
    the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three
    burst into a laugh.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let the charwoman alone to be the first!&rdquo; cried she who
    had entered first. &ldquo;Let the laundress alone to be the second;
    and let the undertaker&rsquo;s man alone to be the third. Look
    here, old Joe, here&rsquo;s a chance! If we haven&rsquo;t all three met
    here without meaning it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have met in a better place,&rdquo; said old Joe,
    removing his pipe from his mouth. &ldquo;Come into the parlour.
    You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other
    two an&rsquo;t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.
    Ah! How it skreeks! There an&rsquo;t such a rusty bit of metal
    in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s
    no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We&rsquo;re all suitable
    to our calling, we&rsquo;re well matched. Come into the
    parlour. Come into the parlour.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The
    old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and
    having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the
    stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.</p>

    <p>While he did this, the woman who had already spoken
    threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting
    manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and
    looking with a bold defiance at the other two.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?&rdquo; said the
    woman. &ldquo;Every person has a right to take care of themselves.
    <i>He</i> always did.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, indeed!&rdquo; said the laundress. &ldquo;No man
    more so.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why then, don&rsquo;t stand staring as if you was afraid,
    woman; who&rsquo;s the wiser? We&rsquo;re not going to pick holes in
    each other&rsquo;s coats, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.
    "We should hope not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.
    Who&rsquo;s the worse for the loss of a few things like these?
    Not a dead man, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If he wanted to keep &rsquo;em after he was dead, a wicked old
    screw,&rdquo; pursued the woman, &ldquo;why wasn&rsquo;t he natural in his
    lifetime? If he had been, he&rsquo;d have had somebody to look
    after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying
    gasping out his last there, alone by himself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truest word that ever was spoke,&rdquo; said Mrs.
    Dilber. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a judgment on him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish it was a little heavier judgment,&rdquo; replied the
    woman; &ldquo;and it should have been, you may depend upon it,
    if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that
    bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out
    plain. I&rsquo;m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to
    see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,
    before we met here, I believe. It&rsquo;s no sin. Open the bundle,
    Joe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;
    and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,
    produced <i>his</i> plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,
    a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no
    great value, were all. They were severally examined and
    appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed
    to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a
    total when he found there was nothing more to come.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your account,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t give
    another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.
    Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing
    apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of
    sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall
    in the same manner.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I always give too much to ladies. It&rsquo;s a weakness of mine,
    and that&rsquo;s the way I ruin myself,&rdquo; said old Joe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made
    it an open question, I&rsquo;d repent of being so liberal and knock
    off half-a-crown.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now undo <i>my</i> bundle, Joe,&rdquo; said the first woman.</p>

    <p>Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience
    of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,
    dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you call this?&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Bed-curtains!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward
    on her crossed arms. &ldquo;Bed-curtains!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you took &rsquo;em down, rings and
    all, with him lying there?&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes I do,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You were born to make your fortune,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and
    you&rsquo;ll certainly do it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I certainly shan&rsquo;t hold my hand, when I can get anything
    in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He
    was, I promise you, Joe,&rdquo; returned the woman coolly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    drop that oil upon the blankets, now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;His blankets?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Whose else&rsquo;s do you think?&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;He
    isn&rsquo;t likely to take cold without &rsquo;em, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hope he didn&rsquo;t die of anything catching? Eh?&rdquo; said
    old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid of that,&rdquo; returned the woman. &ldquo;I
    an&rsquo;t so fond of his company that I&rsquo;d loiter about him for
    such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that
    shirt till your eyes ache; but you won&rsquo;t find a hole in it, nor
    a threadbare place. It&rsquo;s the best he had, and a fine one too.
    They&rsquo;d have wasted it, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you call wasting of it?&rdquo; asked old Joe.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,&rdquo; replied
    the woman with a laugh. &ldquo;Somebody was fool enough to
    do it, but I took it off again. If calico an&rsquo;t good enough for
    such a purpose, it isn&rsquo;t good enough for anything. It&rsquo;s quite
    as becoming to the body. He can&rsquo;t look uglier than he did
    in that one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat
    grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by
    the old man&rsquo;s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and
    disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they
    had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the same woman, when old Joe,
    producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their
    several gains upon the ground. &ldquo;This is the end of it, you
    see! He frightened every one away from him when he was
    alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. &ldquo;I
    see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.
    My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is
    this!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now
    he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,
    beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,
    which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful
    language.</p>

    <p>The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with
    any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience
    to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it
    was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon
    the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,
    uncared for, was the body of this man.</p>

    <p>Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand
    was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted
    that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon
    Scrooge&rsquo;s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought
    of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;
    but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss
    the spectre at his side.</p>

    <p>Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar
    here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy
    command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,
    revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair
    to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is
    not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;
    it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the
    hand <font style="font-variant: small-caps">was</font> open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,
    and tender; and the pulse a man&rsquo;s. Strike, Shadow, strike!
    And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow
    the world with life immortal!</p>

    <p>No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge&rsquo;s ears, and
    yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He
    thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be
    his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?
    They have brought him to a rich end, truly!</p>

    <p>He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a
    woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this
    or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be
    kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was
    a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What
    <i>they</i> wanted in the room of death, and why they were so
    restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is a fearful place. In leaving it,
    I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the
    head.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; Scrooge returned, &ldquo;and I would do
    it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have
    not the power.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Again it seemed to look upon him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion
    caused by this man&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Scrooge quite agonised,
    "show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a
    moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room
    by daylight, where a mother and her children were.</p>

    <p>She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;
    for she walked up and down the room; started at every
    sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;
    tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly
    bear the voices of the children in their play.</p>

    <p>At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried
    to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was
    careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was
    a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight
    of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.</p>

    <p>He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for
    him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news
    (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared
    embarrassed how to answer.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or bad?"&mdash;to help him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are quite ruined?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. There is hope yet, Caroline.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If <i>he</i> relents,&rdquo; she said, amazed, &ldquo;there is! Nothing is
    past hope, if such a miracle has happened.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He is past relenting,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke
    truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she
    said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next
    moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of
    her heart.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last
    night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a
    week&rsquo;s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid
    me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only
    very ill, but dying, then.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To whom will our debt be transferred?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But before that time we shall be ready
    with the money; and even though we were not, it would be
    a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his
    successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.
    The children&rsquo;s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what
    they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier
    house for this man&rsquo;s death! The only emotion that the
    Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of
    pleasure.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,&rdquo; said
    Scrooge; &ldquo;or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just
    now, will be for ever present to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
    to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and
    there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They
    entered poor Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s house; the dwelling he had
    visited before; and found the mother and the children seated
    round the fire.</p>

    <p>Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as
    still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,
    who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters
    were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;And He took a child, and set him in the midst of
    them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not
    dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he
    and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not
    go on?</p>

    <p>The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her
    hand up to her face.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The colour hurts my eyes,&rdquo; she said.</p>

    <p>The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re better now again,&rdquo; said Cratchit&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;It
    makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn&rsquo;t show weak
    eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It
    must be near his time.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Past it rather,&rdquo; Peter answered, shutting up his book.
    "But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,
    these few last evenings, mother.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a
    steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have known him walk with&mdash;I have known him walk
    with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Often.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; exclaimed another. So had all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But he was very light to carry,&rdquo; she resumed, intent upon
    her work, &ldquo;and his father loved him so, that it was no
    trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his 
    comforter&mdash;he had need of it, poor fellow&mdash;came in. His tea
    was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should
    help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got
    upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against
    his face, as if they said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it, father. Don&rsquo;t be
    grieved!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to
    all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and
    praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.
    They would be done long before Sunday, he said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?&rdquo; said his
    wife.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; returned Bob. &ldquo;I wish you could have
    gone. It would have done you good to see how green a
    place it is. But you&rsquo;ll see it often. I promised him that I
    would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!&rdquo;
    cried Bob. &ldquo;My little child!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He broke down all at once. He couldn&rsquo;t help it. If he
    could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther
    apart perhaps than they were.</p>

    <p>He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,
    which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.
    There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were
    signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat
    down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed
    himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what
    had happened, and went down again quite happy.</p>

    <p>They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother
    working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness
    of Mr. Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but
    once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing
    that he looked a little&mdash;"just a little down you know,&rdquo; said
    Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. &ldquo;On
    which,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman
    you ever heard, I told him. &lsquo;I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.
    Cratchit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and heartily sorry for your good wife.&rsquo;
    By the bye, how he ever knew <i>that</i>, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Knew what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, that you were a good wife,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Everybody knows that!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Very well observed, my boy!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;I hope they
    do. &lsquo;Heartily sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for your good wife. If I
    can be of service to you in any way,&rsquo; he said, giving me
    his card, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where I live. Pray come to me.&rsquo; Now, it
    wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Bob, &ldquo;for the sake of anything he might be
    able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was
    quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our
    Tiny Tim, and felt with us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a good soul!&rdquo; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You would be surer of it, my dear,&rdquo; returned Bob, &ldquo;if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all 
    surprised&mdash;mark what I say!&mdash;if he got Peter a better 
    situation.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Only hear that, Peter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; cried one of the girls, &ldquo;Peter will be keeping
    company with some one, and setting up for himself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Get along with you!&rdquo; retorted Peter, grinning.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as likely as not,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;one of these days;
    though there&rsquo;s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however
    and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we
    shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim&mdash;shall we&mdash;or this
    first parting that there was among us?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Never, father!&rdquo; cried they all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I know,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I know, my dears, that when
    we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he
    was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among
    ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, never, father!&rdquo; they all cried again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; said little Bob, &ldquo;I am very happy!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the
    two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook
    hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from
    God!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spectre,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;something informs me that our
    parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not
    how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as
    before&mdash;though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there
    seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were
    in the Future&mdash;into the resorts of business men, but showed
    him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,
    but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,
    until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This court,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;through which we hurry now,
    is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length
    of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,
    in days to come!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The house is yonder,&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do you
    point away?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The inexorable finger underwent no change.</p>

    <p>Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked
    in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was
    not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.
    The Phantom pointed as before.</p>

    <p>He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither
    he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.
    He paused to look round before entering.</p>

    <p>A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name
    he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a
    worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and
    weeds, the growth of vegetation&rsquo;s death, not life; choked up
    with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A
    worthy place!</p>

    <p>The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to
    One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was
    exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new
    meaning in its solemn shape.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,&rdquo;
    said Scrooge, &ldquo;answer me one question. Are these the
    shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of
    things that May be, only?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
    it stood.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if
    persevered in, they must lead,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;But if the
    courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is
    thus with what you show me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit was immovable as ever.</p>

    <p>Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and
    following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected
    grave his own name, <font style="font-variant: small-caps">Ebenezer Scrooge</font>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Am <i>I</i> that man who lay upon the bed?&rdquo; he cried, upon
    his knees.</p>

    <p>The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, Spirit! Oh no, no!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The finger still was there.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; he cried, tight clutching at its robe, &ldquo;hear me!
    I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must
    have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I
    am past all hope!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For the first time the hand appeared to shake.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good Spirit,&rdquo; he pursued, as down upon the ground he
    fell before it: &ldquo;Your nature intercedes for me, and pities
    me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you
    have shown me, by an altered life!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The kind hand trembled.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it
    all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the
    Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I
    will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I
    may sponge away the writing on this stone!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to
    free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.
    The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.</p>

    <p>Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate
    reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom&rsquo;s hood and dress.
    It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.</p>
