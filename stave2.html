    <h2 id="stave2">STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS</h2>

    <p>WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,
    he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from
    the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to
    pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a
    neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened
    for the hour.</p>

    <p>To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from
    six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to
    twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he
    went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have
    got into the works. Twelve!</p>

    <p>He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most
    preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:
    and stopped.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;that I can have
    slept through a whole day and far into another night. It
    isn&rsquo;t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and
    this is twelve at noon!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,
    and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub
    the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he
    could see anything; and could see very little then. All he
    could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely
    cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,
    and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been
    if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the
    world.  This was a great relief, because &ldquo;three days after sight
    of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his
    order,&rdquo; and so forth, would have become a mere United States&rsquo;
    security if there were no days to count by.</p>

    <p>Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought
    it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he
    thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured
    not to think, the more he thought.</p>

    <p>Marley&rsquo;s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved
    within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his
    mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first
    position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,
    "Was it a dream or not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters
    more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned
    him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie
    awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could
    no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the
    wisest resolution in his power.</p>

    <p>The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he
    must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.
    At length it broke upon his listening ear.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A quarter past,&rdquo; said Scrooge, counting.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Half-past!&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A quarter to it,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The hour itself,&rdquo; said Scrooge, triumphantly, &ldquo;and nothing else!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a
    deep, dull, hollow, melancholy <font style="font-variant: small-caps">One</font>.  Light flashed up in the room
    upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.</p>

    <p>The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a
    hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his
    back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains
    of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a
    half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the
    unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now
    to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.</p>

    <p>It was a strange figure&mdash;like a child: yet not so like a
    child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural
    medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded
    from the view, and being diminished to a child&rsquo;s proportions.
    Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was
    white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
    it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were
    very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold
    were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately
    formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic
    of the purest white; and round its waist was bound
    a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held
    a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular
    contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed
    with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,
    that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
    jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was
    doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a
    great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.</p>

    <p>Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing
    steadiness, was <i>not</i> its strangest quality. For as its belt
    sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,
    and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so
    the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a
    thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,
    now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a
    body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible
    in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the
    very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and
    clear as ever.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to
    me?&rdquo; asked Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if
    instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who, and what are you?&rdquo; Scrooge demanded.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Long past?&rdquo; inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish
    stature.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No. Your past.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if
    anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire
    to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Ghost, &ldquo;would you so soon put out,
    with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough
    that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and
    force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
    my brow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend
    or any knowledge of having wilfully &ldquo;bonneted&rdquo; the Spirit at
    any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what
    business brought him there.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your welfare!&rdquo; said the Ghost.</p>

    <p>Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not
    help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been
    more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard
    him thinking, for it said immediately:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your reclamation, then. Take heed!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him
    gently by the arm.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Rise! and walk with me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the
    weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;
    that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below
    freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,
    dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at
    that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman&rsquo;s hand,
    was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit
    made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am a mortal,&rdquo; Scrooge remonstrated, &ldquo;and liable to fall.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bear but a touch of my hand <i>there</i>,&rdquo; said the Spirit,
    laying it upon his heart, &ldquo;and you shall be upheld in more
    than this!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,
    and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either
    hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it
    was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished
    with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon
    the ground.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,
    as he looked about him. &ldquo;I was bred in this place. I was
    a boy here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,
    though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still
    present to the old man&rsquo;s sense of feeling. He was conscious
    of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected
    with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares
    long, long, forgotten!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your lip is trembling,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;And what is
    that upon your cheek?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,
    that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him
    where he would.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You recollect the way?&rdquo; inquired the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Remember it!&rdquo; cried Scrooge with fervour; &ldquo;I could
    walk it blindfold.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!&rdquo; observed
    the Ghost. &ldquo;Let us go on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every
    gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared
    in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
    Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them
    with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in
    country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys
    were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the
    broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air
    laughed to hear it!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;These are but shadows of the things that have been,&rdquo; said
    the Ghost. &ldquo;They have no consciousness of us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge
    knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond
    all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and
    his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled
    with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry
    Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for
    their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?
    Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done
    to him?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The school is not quite deserted,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;A
    solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.</p>

    <p>They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and
    soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little
    weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell
    hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken
    fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls
    were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their
    gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;
    and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.
    Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for
    entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open
    doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,
    cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a
    chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow
    with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too
    much to eat.</p>

    <p>They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a
    door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and
    disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by
    lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely
    boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down
    upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he
    used to be.</p>

    <p>Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle
    from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the
    half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among
    the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle
    swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in
    the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening
    influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.</p>

    <p>The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his
    younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in
    foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:
    stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and
    leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Ali Baba!&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas
    time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,
    he <i>did</i> come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And
    Valentine,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;and his wild brother, Orson; there
    they go! And what&rsquo;s his name, who was put down in his
    drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don&rsquo;t you see him!
    And the Sultan&rsquo;s Groom turned upside down by the Genii;
    there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I&rsquo;m glad of it.
    What business had <i>he</i> to be married to the Princess!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature
    on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between
    laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited
    face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in
    the city, indeed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Parrot!&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;Green body and
    yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
    top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called
    him, when he came home again after sailing round the
    island. &lsquo;Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin
    Crusoe?&rsquo;  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn&rsquo;t.
    It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running
    for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his
    usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, &ldquo;Poor
    boy!&rdquo; and cried again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his
    pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his
    cuff: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the Spirit.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Nothing. There was a boy
    singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should
    like to have given him something: that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:
    saying as it did so, &ldquo;Let us see another Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s former self grew larger at the words, and the
    room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,
    the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the
    ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how
    all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you
    do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything
    had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all
    the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.</p>

    <p>He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.
    Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of
    his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.</p>

    <p>It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,
    came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and
    often kissing him, addressed him as her &ldquo;Dear, dear
    brother.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have come to bring you home, dear brother!&rdquo; said the
    child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.
    "To bring you home, home, home!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Home, little Fan?&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the child, brimful of glee. &ldquo;Home, for good
    and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder
    than he used to be, that home&rsquo;s like Heaven! He spoke so
    gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that
    I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
    home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach
    to bring you. And you&rsquo;re to be a man!&rdquo; said the child,
    opening her eyes, &ldquo;and are never to come back here; but
    first, we&rsquo;re to be together all the Christmas long, and have
    the merriest time in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are quite a woman, little Fan!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.</p>

    <p>She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his
    head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on
    tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her
    childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to
    go, accompanied her.</p>

    <p>A terrible voice in the hall cried, &ldquo;Bring down Master
    Scrooge&rsquo;s box, there!&rdquo; and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster
    himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious
    condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind
    by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his
    sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that
    ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial
    and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.
    Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a
    block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments
    of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,
    sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of &ldquo;something&rdquo;
    to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,
    but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had
    rather not. Master Scrooge&rsquo;s trunk being by this time tied
    on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster
    good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove
    gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the
    hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens
    like spray.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have
    withered,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;But she had a large heart!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So she had,&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I will not
    gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She died a woman,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;and had, as I think,
    children.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One child,&rdquo; Scrooge returned.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;Your nephew!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,
    "Yes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Although they had but that moment left the school behind
    them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,
    where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy
    carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and
    tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by
    the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas
    time again; but it was evening, and the streets were
    lighted up.</p>

    <p>The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked
    Scrooge if he knew it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Know it!&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;Was I apprenticed here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh
    wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two
    inches taller he must have knocked his head against the
    ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it&rsquo;s Fezziwig
    alive again!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the
    clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his
    hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over
    himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and
    called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Scrooge&rsquo;s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly
    in, accompanied by his fellow-&rsquo;prentice.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dick Wilkins, to be sure!&rdquo; said Scrooge to the Ghost.
    "Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached
    to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yo ho, my boys!&rdquo; said Fezziwig. &ldquo;No more work to-night.
    Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let&rsquo;s
    have the shutters up,&rdquo; cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap
    of his hands, &ldquo;before a man can say Jack Robinson!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how those two fellows went at it!
    They charged into the street with the shutters&mdash;one, two,
    three&mdash;had &rsquo;em up in their places&mdash;four, five, six&mdash;barred
    &rsquo;em and pinned &rsquo;em&mdash;seven, eight, nine&mdash;and came back
    before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hilli-ho!&rdquo; cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the
    high desk, with wonderful agility. &ldquo;Clear away, my lads,
    and let&rsquo;s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,
    Ebenezer!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn&rsquo;t have cleared
    away, or couldn&rsquo;t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking
    on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if
    it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was
    swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon
    the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and
    bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter&rsquo;s
    night.</p>

    <p>In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the
    lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty
    stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial
    smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and
    lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they
    broke. In came all the young men and women employed in
    the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the
    baker. In came the cook, with her brother&rsquo;s particular friend,
    the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was
    suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying
    to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who
    was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.
    In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,
    some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;
    in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,
    twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again
    the other way; down the middle and up again; round
    and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old
    top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top
    couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top
    couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When
    this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his
    hands to stop the dance, cried out, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; and the
    fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially
    provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his
    reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no
    dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,
    exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man
    resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.</p>

    <p>There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more
    dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there
    was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece
    of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.
    But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast
    and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort
    of man who knew his business better than you or I could
    have told it him!) struck up &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverley.&rdquo;  Then
    old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top
    couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;
    three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were
    not to be trifled with; people who <i>would</i> dance, and had no
    notion of walking.</p>

    <p>But if they had been twice as many&mdash;ah, four times&mdash;old
    Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would
    Mrs. Fezziwig. As to <i>her</i>, she was worthy to be his partner
    in every sense of the term. If that&rsquo;s not high praise, tell me
    higher, and I&rsquo;ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue
    from Fezziwig&rsquo;s calves. They shone in every part of the
    dance like moons. You couldn&rsquo;t have predicted, at any given
    time, what would have become of them next. And when old
    Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;
    advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and
    curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to
    your place; Fezziwig &ldquo;cut"&mdash;cut so deftly, that he appeared
    to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without
    a stagger.</p>

    <p>When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
    Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side
    of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually
    as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.
    When everybody had retired but the two &rsquo;prentices, they did
    the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,
    and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a
    counter in the back-shop.</p>

    <p>During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a
    man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,
    and with his former self. He corroborated everything,
    remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent
    the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the
    bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from
    them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious
    that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its
    head burnt very clear.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A small matter,&rdquo; said the Ghost, &ldquo;to make these silly
    folks so full of gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Small!&rdquo; echoed Scrooge.</p>

    <p>The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,
    who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:
    and when he had done so, said,</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of
    your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so
    much that he deserves this praise?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and
    speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.
    "It isn&rsquo;t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy
    or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a
    pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and
    looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is
    impossible to add and count &rsquo;em up: what then? The happiness
    he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He felt the Spirit&rsquo;s glance, and stopped.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing particular,&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Something, I think?&rdquo; the Ghost insisted.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;No. I should like to be able to say
    a word or two to my clerk just now. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance
    to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by
    side in the open air.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My time grows short,&rdquo; observed the Spirit. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he
    could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again
    Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime
    of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later
    years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.
    There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which
    showed the passion that had taken root, and where the
    shadow of the growing tree would fall.</p>

    <p>He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young
    girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,
    which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of
    Christmas Past.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;To you, very little.
    Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort
    you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have
    no just cause to grieve.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What Idol has displaced you?&rdquo; he rejoined.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A golden one.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This is the even-handed dealing of the world!&rdquo; he said.
    "There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and
    there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity
    as the pursuit of wealth!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You fear the world too much,&rdquo; she answered, gently.
    "All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being
    beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your
    nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,
    Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Even if I have grown so
    much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She shook her head.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were
    both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could
    improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You
    <i>are</i> changed. When it was made, you were another man.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was a boy,&rdquo; he said impatiently.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you
    are,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I am. That which promised happiness
    when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that
    we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of
    this, I will not say. It is enough that I <i>have</i> thought of it,
    and can release you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have I ever sought release?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In words. No. Never.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In what, then?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another
    atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In
    everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
    sight. If this had never been between us,&rdquo; said the girl,
    looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; &ldquo;tell me,
    would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in
    spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, &ldquo;You think
    not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I would gladly think otherwise if I could,&rdquo; she answered,
    "Heaven knows! When <i>I</i> have learned a Truth like this,
    I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you
    were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe
    that you would choose a dowerless girl&mdash;you who, in your
    very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,
    choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your
    one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your
    repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I
    release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you
    once were.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He was about to speak; but with her head turned from
    him, she resumed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You may&mdash;the memory of what is past half makes me
    hope you will&mdash;have pain in this. A very, very brief time,
    and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an
    unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you
    awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She left him, and they parted.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge, &ldquo;show me no more! Conduct
    me home. Why do you delight to torture me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One shadow more!&rdquo; exclaimed the Ghost.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No more!&rdquo; cried Scrooge. &ldquo;No more. I don&rsquo;t wish to
    see it. Show me no more!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,
    and forced him to observe what happened next.</p>

    <p>They were in another scene and place; a room, not very
    large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter
    fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge
    believed it was the same, until he saw <i>her</i>, now a comely
    matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this
    room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children
    there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;
    and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not
    forty children conducting themselves like one, but every
    child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences
    were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;
    on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,
    and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to
    mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands
    most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of
    them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I
    wouldn&rsquo;t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
    braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little
    shoe, I wouldn&rsquo;t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to
    save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they
    did, bold young brood, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it; I should
    have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,
    and never come straight again. And yet I should
    have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have
    questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have
    looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never
    raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of
    which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should
    have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence
    of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its
    value.</p>

    <p>But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a
    rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
    plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed
    and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who
    came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys
    and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and
    the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!
    The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his
    pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight
    by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,
    and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of
    wonder and delight with which the development of every
    package was received! The terrible announcement that the
    baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll&rsquo;s frying-pan
    into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having
    swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!
    The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,
    and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.
    It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions
    got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the
    top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.</p>

    <p>And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,
    when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning
    fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his
    own fireside; and when he thought that such another
    creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might
    have called him father, and been a spring-time in the
    haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said the husband, turning to his wife with a
    smile, &ldquo;I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How can I? Tut, don&rsquo;t I know?&rdquo; she added in the
    same breath, laughing as he laughed. &ldquo;Mr. Scrooge.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as
    it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could
    scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point
    of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in
    the world, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Spirit!&rdquo; said Scrooge in a broken voice, &ldquo;remove me
    from this place.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I told you these were shadows of the things that have
    been,&rdquo; said the Ghost. &ldquo;That they are what they are, do
    not blame me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Remove me!&rdquo; Scrooge exclaimed, &ldquo;I cannot bear it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon
    him with a face, in which in some strange way there were
    fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which
    the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was
    undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed
    that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly
    connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the
    extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down
    upon its head.</p>

    <p>The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher
    covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down
    with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed
    from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.</p>

    <p>He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an
    irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own
    bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand
    relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank
    into a heavy sleep.</p>
